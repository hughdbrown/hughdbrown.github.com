<p>Before your PC goes to the web to look up a URL to resolve it into a 32-bit address, it performs a lookup in hosts.txt. Putting known spammers and the like into your hosts.txt and having them resolve to the local host cause these sites to be unreachable from your machine -- a good thing.</p>

<p>How to use this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download hosts.txt from <a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt">www.mvps.org/</a></li>
	<li>Copy file to %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\</li>
</ul>

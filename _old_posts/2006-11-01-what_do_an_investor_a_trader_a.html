What do an investor, a trader and a gambler have in common? <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/editorials/wagner/2006/1030.html">Hans Wagner</a> argues that an investor, trader, and gambler are similar because they have rules they operate by. I'd like to say there is a larger similarity, perhaps in the content of the rules, but Wagner is not making that claim as fas as I can see.<br /><br />Important elements are:<br /><ul><li>money management</li><li>conserving capital / cutting losses</li><li>the importance of temperament / personality</li><li>finding good trades<br />Fundamentals agree with technicals.<br /></li></ul>

<p>Our resident law geek Stewart Rutledge writes in with a handy Gmail tip.</p>

<p>When sending a message, type the name of the recipient you want to appear in your Contacts and then place the email address inside &lt;&gt;. That will auto-add the name to your address book formatted.</p>

<p>For instance, rather than: stewart@example.com in the To: box, use Master Stewart Rutledge, the Wonderful &lt;stewart@example.com&gt;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this method seems to work in most email clients (Thunderbird, at least) that auto-add recipients to your address book. Thanks, Stewart! ï¿½?" Gina Trapani</p>

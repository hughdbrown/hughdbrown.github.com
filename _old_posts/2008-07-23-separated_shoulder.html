<p>Recently, I injured my shoulder playing in my Ultimate Frisbee league. I took a bad tumble on the field and landed on my shoulder, tearing the ligaments that join the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Pectoral_girdle_front_diagram.svg">clavicle and the scapula</a>. The technical name is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_joint">acromioclavicular joint</a> or a-c joint for short. The complete diagnosis is a <a href="http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/images/1230552-1261906-2058.jpg">grade III separation of the acromioclavicular joint</a>.</p>

<p>It's not especially painful but the recovery time is fairly high (one to three months). Recovery is mostly passively immobilizing the shoulder in a sling and later physiotherapy to regain strength and range of motion. I'm looking for good sources of shoulder exercises, like these:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article.asp?section=845">ShoulderDoc</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.uptodateonline.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~8Xm8h.pwl70pNy">UptoDateOnline</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But it comes with a permanent outcome: there's going to be a bump on my left shoulder for good.</p>

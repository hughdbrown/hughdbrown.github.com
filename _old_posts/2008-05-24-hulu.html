<p>Wow, this is so great. Hulu, a website I had not even heard of until today, has TV shows streamed over the internet. For most people, this would be no big deal. I have no cable, though, and use the TV only for watching DVDs.</p>

<p>Right now, I am catching up on <i>House</i> episodes which I would otherwise have to wait until, oh, September, to see on DVD.</p>

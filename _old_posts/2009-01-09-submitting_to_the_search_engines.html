<p>First, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_rq=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Faddurl%2F">find the search engine submission pages</a>. This is not nearly so obvious as you'd think. Many search engines make it really hard to find their site submission pages. That's why I ended up relying on links to pages similar to Google's submission page:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/">Google</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit">Yahoo</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx">Windows Live</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/help/webmasters">Alexa</a></li>
</ul>

<p>AOL and a few of the others rely on Yahoo for submission, and the page they link to does not actually allow submission. Ay ay ay.</p>

<p>If all the numbers 1..n were present, then they would sum to <b>n(n+1)/2</b>.
If some x is absent, then they will sum to <b>n(n+1)/2 - x</b>. So to determine which number is missing, subtract the sum of the series from the expected sum.</p>

<p>This python code finds the missing number in the series named values:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">def test(values) :
	max_val = len(values) + 1
	expected_sum = max_val*(max_val + 1) / 2
	return expected_sum - sum(values)</pre>

<p>Here is a complete test:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">import random
def test(values) :
	max_val = len(values) + 1
	expected_sum = max_val*(max_val + 1) / 2
	return expected_sum - sum(values)

test_range = 200
for i in range(1,test_range) :
	a = range(1, i) + range(i+1, test_range+1)
	random.shuffle(a)
	x = test(a)
	if x != i :
		print "Failed at ", i
		print a
		print sum(a)
		break</pre>

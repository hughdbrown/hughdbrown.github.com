<p>A duck went into a bar one day and asked the barkeeper for some grapes.</p>
<p>"Don't have any grapes," the barkeep replied.</p>
<p>Next day the duck waltzes in again, hops up on a stool and asks, "Got any grapes?"</p>
<p>"I have no grapes," the barman shouts, "This is a bar, not a grocery store."</p>
<p>The following day the duck arrives at the bar again and repeats the same question. "Got any grapes?"</p>
<p>"For the last time," the barman roars: "I have no grapes and if you come back in here again asking the same stupid question, I'll nail your @#$!! feet to the counter."</p>
<p>Day four and the duck saunters into the bar. "Got a hammer?"</p>
<p>"NO!"</p>
<p>"Got any nails?"</p>
<p>"NO!"</p>
<p>"Got any grapes?"</p>

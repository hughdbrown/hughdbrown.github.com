<h1>Support and Resistance: The Greatest Trading Tool</h1>
<p>A good article on trading in general and on support and resistance specifically.</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>Despite all the hype from the internet marketers who try to sell you the latest trading 'secrets', the fact is there are NO secrets.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify setups which provide the potential for lower risk and/or higher probability trades. </li>
	<li>Enter and manage those trades in a consistent and disciplined manner. </li>
	<li>Minimize risk. </li>
	<li>Manage your money. </li>
	<li>Manage your emotions.</li>
	<li>Journal your results, and review them to identify what's working and what's not working. </li>
	<li>Keep doing what is working, and </li>
	<li>Improve what is not working.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not trading successfully, it's because you're not doing one (or perhaps all) of these things.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was going through some old web material and came across my links on cargo cult. The idea, originally developed by Richard Feynman, is that people develop a false idea of causation and do the wrong things to try to produce the desired effect. <i>Cargo cult programming</i> has become a common expression in software development to describe "a style of computer programming that is characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose."

<blockquote class="quote"><p>A cargo cult is any of a group of unorthodox religious movements
appearing in tribal societies in the wake of Western impact, especially
in New Guinea and Melanesia. Cargo cults sometimes maintain that
manufactured western goods ("cargo") have been created by divine
spirits and are intended for the local indigenous people, but that
white people have unfairly gained control of these objects. Cargo cults
thus focus on overcoming what they perceive as undue 'white' influences
by conducting rituals similar to the white behavior they have observed,
presuming that the ancestors will at last recognize their own and send
them cargo. Thus a characteristic feature of cargo cults is the belief
that spiritual agents will at some future time give much valuable cargo
and desirable manufactured products to the cult members. In other
instances such as on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu, cult members
worship Americans who brought the cargo.</p>
<p>Based on the above definition, cargo cult is also used in business and
science to refer to a particular type of fallacy whereby ill-considered
effort and ceremony takes place but goes unrewarded due to a flawed
model of causation.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The island's John Frum movement is a classic example of what anthropologists have called a "cargo cult" -- many of which sprang up in villages in the South Pacific during World War II, when hundreds of thousands of American troops poured into the islands from the skies and seas. As anthropologist Kirk Huffman, who spent 17 years in Vanuatu, explains: "You get cargo cults when the outside world, with all its material wealth, suddenly descends on remote, indigenous tribes." The locals don't know where the foreigners' endless supplies come from and so suspect they were summoned by magic, sent from the spirit world. To entice the Americans back after the war, islanders throughout the region constructed piers and carved airstrips from their fields. They prayed for ships and planes to once again come out of nowhere, bearing all kinds of treasures: jeeps and washing machines, radios and motorcycles, canned meat and candy.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned 
are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the 
South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw 
airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to 
happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put
fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man 
to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars 
of bamboo sticking out like antennas -- he's the controller -- and they wait 
for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form 
is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't 
work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, 
because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific 
investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the 
planes don't land.</p></blockquote></li>

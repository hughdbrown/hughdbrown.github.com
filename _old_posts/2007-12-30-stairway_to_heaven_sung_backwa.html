<p>Jeroen Offerman sings this backwards but the recording is played forwards. People in the background move backwards. You can see for yourself how accurately he has rendered it.<br /><br />[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp_iEWZnYok">Stairway to Heaven sung backwards</a>]<p>

<p>2008-05-24: removed from YouTube for copyright infringement. Also removed from Jeroen Offerman's <a href="http://www.jeroenofferman.com/">site</a>.</p>

<p>As an alternative, I rather like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbkNxYaULBw">this</a>.</p>

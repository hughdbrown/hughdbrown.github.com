<p>Dev102.com poses this programming challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>Your input is a string which is composed from bracket characters. The allowed characters are:'(', ')', '['. ']', '{', '}', '<' and '>'. Your mission is to determine whether the brackets structure is legal or not.</p>

<p>Example of a legal expression: "([](<{}>))".</p>

<p>Example of an illegal expression: "({<)>}".</p>

<p>Provide the most efficient, elegant and simple solution for that problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's pretty obvious to me that you push opening brackets on the stack and pop off closing brackets, ensuring that the correct closing bracket is encountered. Like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">def Evaluate(str):
  stack = []
  pushChars, popChars = "<({[", ">)}]"
  for c in str :
    if c in pushChars :
      stack.append(c)
    elif c in popChars :
      if not len(stack) :
        return False
      else :
        stackTop = stack.pop()
        balancingBracket = pushChars[popChars.index(c)]
        if stackTop != balancingBracket :
          return False
    else :
      return False
  return not len(stack)</pre>

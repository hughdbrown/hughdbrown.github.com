<p>I saw <a href="http://www.snap.com/snapshots.php">this</a> in someone else's website: any link on your page that you hover over pops up a snapshot image of the page. Cool!</p>

<p>I decided I needed to add it to my own Movable Type website. As near as I can tell, it just requires adding some JavaScript to the Footer template.</p>

<p>Recently, I was given a programming problem for a pre-interview job screen.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><b>Implementation</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Create a class which implements either the C# or Java interface</li>
<li>Implement the two methods defined in the interface. FindMaxValue should return the single highest integer. FindTopNValues should return a list of the highest 'n' values in the source list</li>
<li>Any assumptions or design choices made during the implementation should be documented.</li>
</ul>
<b>C# interface</b><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">namespace Test
{
   public interface IFindTopValues
   {
      int FindMaxValue(int[] values);
      int[] FindTopNValue(int[] values, int count);
   }
}
</pre>
<b>Test cases</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Describe the test cases which you would implement for this class.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="/files/programming-challenge-find-top.html">the solution</a> I produced. It uses a C# generic PriorityQueue class. Have a look -- it's useful, reusable code.</p>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>Update (2008-05-15): I noticed that Julian Bucknall had a <a href="http://www.boyet.com/Articles/PriorityQueueLimited.html">change to his priority queue</a> that ordered entries by priority and time of entry. I decided to <a href="/files/better-priorityqueue.html">update my code</a> to provide the same ability.</p>

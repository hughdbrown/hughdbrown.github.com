<h1><a href="http://www.chronogram.com/issue/2006/02/news/index.php">See Only Evil</a></h1>

<p>Author interviews CIA agent whose memoir was the basis for the film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/">Syriana</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>It is Baer's memoir, <em>See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War Against Terrorism</em> (Crown Publishers, 2002), that Syriana is based upon. Baer served mostly in the Middle East--Beirut, Lebanon and Iraq--as well as in Sudan, Morocco, and one tour in Paris. His job was to "run agents or sources across the Middle East gathering Intelligence." An Arabic speaker, he was considered one of the best on-the-ground field officers in the Middle East. In <em>See No Evil</em>, Baer says that there is evidence linking Iran to attacks on American interests, including the Khobar Towers bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 US soldiers in 1996. He says that Iran has been mishandled by US diplomats since the 1980s, and that American foreign policy regarding the Islamic Republic is based on myths and misinformation.</p></blockquote>

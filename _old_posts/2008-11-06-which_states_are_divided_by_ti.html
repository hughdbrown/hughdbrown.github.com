<p>During the election, there was some concern that news media were listing a single time for the polls to close in states that have two time zones, making it possible that people might arrive at the polls too late.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Although most states lie within a single time zones, there are thirteen states that are divided into two time zones.</p>

<p>Idaho and Oregon are split between the Mountain and Pacific time zones. Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas are divided between Central and Mountain time zones. Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee are split between Eastern and Central time zones. Finally, Alaska is divided between the Alaska time zone and the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone.</p></blockquote>

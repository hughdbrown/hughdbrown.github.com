<p>I'm moving my old website over, and the first order of business is to put up the popular old content. And what's more popular than <a href="/projects/NScript.asp">NullScript</a>, the language about nothing?</p>

<p>Technical aside: since my website was upgraded to a new server, none of the NullScript links has worked because IIS appears to reject any file that begins with NUL*. So I renamed all my NullScriptx.* files to NScriptx.*. I expect that my incoming links will all be broken. At least google will patch this up in time.</p>

<p>And apparently, you can't even title an entry with Null*.</p>

Scans allow you to quickly find all of the stocks, mutual funds, and indices in our database that meet whatever technical conditions (also called "scan criteria") that you select. For instance, you can scan all the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and find only those that have reached their 52-week highs.</p>

<p><a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder">TrendAlyzer</a> is a data visualization tool that Google has hidden away. It's really cool. It shows animations of world data by country/year/region with zillions of measures: GDP, life expectancy, child mortality, urban population, etc. Recommended.</p>

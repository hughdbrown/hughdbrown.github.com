<p>Okay, if you get this blog remark:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">Dude.. I am not much into reading, but somehow I got to read lots of articles on your blog. Its amazing how interesting it is for me to visit you very often.</blockquote>
<p>then you have <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=%22I+am+not+much+into+reading%22">spam</a>.</p>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>Update 2009-12-03: Similarly, if you get </p>
<blockquote class="quote">"Good post mate!! Keep 'em flowing!"</blockquote>
<p>then you have <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&source=hp&q="Good+post+mate!!+Keep+'em+flowing!"">spam</a>. I guess comment spammers are going for generic remarks that look like they are paying attention to the blog's content as an alternative to, say, having a genuine interest in the blog's content.</p>

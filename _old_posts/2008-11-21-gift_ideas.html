<p>This is the patented freestanding wine rack that stores 108 bottles horizontally and nine on a top "presentation rack" for a total capacity of 117 bottles, yet occupies less than 4' sq. of floor space. Used by private collectors, fine dining establishments, and prestigious wineries worldwide, the rack's supports are precisely angled and spaced to allow ideal air circulation around each bottle, ensuring an even storage temperature. The unique design also makes bottles appear as if they are suspended in mid-air, and orients bottles with the labels facing you--not the corks--enabling a vintage to be selected without pulling out bottle after bottle.</p></li>

<p>This ingenious planter takes the toil out of tomatoes by elevating the planting bed so vines grow downward.

Complementary plants like basil, parsley, rosemary, and peppers can be planted on top, which holds up to 80 lbs. of topsoil. The compact planter can fit in any space with ample sunlight, even condominium balconies. A hollow base filled with sand (not included) keeps it stable and upright. The plastic planting bed, supported by PVC pipes, has openings for four tomato plants underneath, with pop-out perforations for four additional openings.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://www.hammacher.com/publish/72646.asp?promo=QSearch&ls=EW">The Wearable Blanket</a>
<p>This is the classic blanket that you can wear, either as a traditional blanket, or as a wrap that can be fastened around you for maximum thermal efficiency. Unlike traditional wraps, the blanket can be snapped and zippered closed, leaving your hands free to hold a book or mug, and your feet free to move from couch to fireplace and back. While lounging on the couch, you can snap the bottom closed to prevent heat from escaping near your feet. The snap system also keeps the blanket from slipping so it never has to be pulled back into place while relaxing, ensuring even, constant warmth without cold spots. When not in use, it can be draped across a chair or divan as a throw. The 100% polyester wards off winter cold and is easily machine washed and dried. Imported. 60" x 80". </p></li>

<p>I had a brief look at the C++ source for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ta-lib">TA-Lib: Technical Analysis Library</a> today. It's an open source project I mentioned the <a href="../../2008/05/#001654">other day</a>. It may well be good code, but reading through it is really hard sledding. It's evidently all machine-generated, and I can't work out where the source is. (If I have the choice of reading machine-generated C++ or the source, I'll choose the source.)</p>

<p>But it's not a dead loss. The <a href="http://tadoc.org/">documentation on the associated site</a> is pretty strong and gives good references. In particular, there are links to FM Labs, and I like the descriptions given of <a href="http://www.fmlabs.com/reference/">TA algorithms</a> there.</p>

<p>I'm also intrigued by the Technical Analysis Programmer's Toolkit. I'll download a demo and report back on its suitability.</p>

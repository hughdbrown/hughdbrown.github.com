<p>I like this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2006/04/02/business/20060402_SECTOR_GRAPHIC.htm">graphic of sector performance</a> from the New York Times. Mind you, as my buddy Jeff says, "How is this going to make you money?" I have to admit I don't have a certain way in the market, but I think it is a good high level filter for finding stuff to investigate.</p>

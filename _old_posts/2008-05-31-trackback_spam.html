<p>Wow, I had no idea the trackback spam situation was so bad. I decided to check the comments on my site today: no comments. I checked my trackbacks: 555 trackbacks, 554 of them automatically marked as spam. And the other one was spam, too.</p>

<p>In checking the sources, I found one stand out website for sourcing spam links to my site: weebly.com. The site purports to be an easy-to-use blog provider for the non-technical person, but that's not even the start of the story. Weebly.com appears to be the favored starting point of porn spammers. Here are the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&c2coff=1&safe=off&q=%22dog+porn%22+site%3Aweebly.com&btnG=Search">blogs at weebly</a> that deal with only a specialized porn topic: seven sites all using this specific phrase. Most other blog sites have no hits on this phrase. Looks to me as if this is the preferred location for trackback spammers.</p>

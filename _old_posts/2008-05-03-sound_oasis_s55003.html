Okay, so this is my favorite sleep sound machine. A few of the things that make it so good in my view:<br />
<ul>
<li>the sounds don't repeat very quickly</li>
<li>the sound quality is good</li>
<li>you can add cards to extend the system</li>
<li>there is a great big button to turn it on and off (as opposed to many machines that have combination volume and on-off)</li>
<li>the sound can be played for a set time (30-, 60-, or 90-minutes) and it automatically shuts off</li>
<li>the sound fades out gradually</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/">SleepWellBaby</a> has the best prices: the unit for <a href="http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sound-Oasis-Sound-Conditioner-p/s-550-03.htm">$49.95</a> and the extension cards for <a href="http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=SC-200">$14.95</a>. I got these cards:<br />
<ul>
<li>Rhythms of the Sea Sound Card</li>
<li>Wilderness Journey Sound Card</li>
</ul>
The built-in sounds are pretty good without resorting to expansion cards. My wife is partial to the <a href="http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sounds/summernight.mp3">summer night sounds</a> whereas I prefer the <a href="http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sounds/oceansurf.mp3">ocean surf</a>.

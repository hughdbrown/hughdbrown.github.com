<p>I recently visited my 6 year old nephew, and I thought I'd report back on the significant markers in a young boy's world:</p>
<ul>
	<li>police cars</li>
	<li>snakes and spiders</li>
	<li>sharks and alligators</li>
	<li>tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes</li>
	<li>sandcastles and beaches</li>
	<li>rocks</li>
	<li>Lego</li>
	<li>macaroni and cheese, pizza</li>
	<li>ice cream and cookies</li>
	<li>dinosaurs</li>
	<li>Spiderman and Batman</li>
	<li>chocolate milk</li>
	<li>ants</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you can just talk about these things, you'll certainly keep his attention.</p>

<p>History professor Jerry Z. Muller of The Catholic University of America contends that <a href="http://american.com/archive/2009/our-epistemological-depression">much of the current financial debacle is epistemological in nature</a> -- that it was a failure of the financial actors to understand what they were doing.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The diversification of investment, which was intended to reduce risk to institutional investors, ended up spreading risk more widely, as investors across the country and around the world found themselves holding mortgage-backed American securities of declining and indeterminate value. There was a belief in the financial sector that diversification of assets was a substitute for due diligence on each asset, so that if one bundled enough assets together, one didn't have to know much about the assets themselves. The creation of securities based on a pool of diverse assets (mortgage loans, student loans, credit card receivables, etc.) meant that when markets declined radically, it became impossible to determine an accurate price for the security.</p></blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>From the point of view of top management, the diversity of operations means that executives were managing assets and services with which they have little familiarity. This has led to the spread of pseudo-objectivity: the search for standardized measures of achievement across large and disparate organizations. Its implicit premises were these: that information which is numerically measurable is the only sort of knowledge necessary; that numerical data can substitute for other forms of inquiry; and that numerical acumen can substitute for practical knowledge about the underlying assets and services.</p></blockquote>

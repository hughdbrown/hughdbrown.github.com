<blockquote class="quote"><p>Kevin: Imagine that I let you borrow $50, but in exchange for my generosity, you promise to pay me back the $50 with an extra $10 in interest. To make sure you pay me back, I take your Charizard Pokemon card as collateral.</p>

<p>Olivia: Kevin, I don't play Pokemon anymore.</p>

<p>Kevin: I'm getting to that. Let's say that the Charizard is worth $50, so in case you decide to not return my money, at least I'll have something that's worth what I loaned out.</p>

<p>Olivia: Okay.</p>

<p>Kevin: But one day, people realize that Pokemon is stupid and everyone decides that the cards are overvalued. That's right--everybody turned twelve on the same day! Now your Charizard is only worth, say, $25.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are using Movable Type and using WebHosting4Life.com as your ISP, you will not be able to get comments and trackbacks to work until you turn off the WebHosting4Life setting, Security Guard. If, whenever you post a comment on your blog, you get this error message:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>Webhost4life Application Firewall Alert</p>

<p>Your request triggered an alert! If you feel that you have
received this page in error, please contact the
administrator of this web site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you need to do this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Login to WebHosting4Life.com</li>
	<li>Go to Security </li>
	<li>Select Security Guard</li>
	<li>Set to OFF</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me three weeks of googling this before I put in the system request and got this fixed. I hope you find this posting sooner.</p>

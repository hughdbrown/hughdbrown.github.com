<p>Recently, a friend wrote about our Ultimate Frisbee field and said:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>the reason we moved the field to the dust bowl was  because of the uneven nature of the south part of our field (23 words)</p></blockquote>

<p>I have a real problem with this construction. It uses a noun clause ("the reason we moved the field to the dust bowl") as the subject of the sentence and tacks on the very weak "was because" to express the idea. "The reason ... was because..." is never necessary nor advisable. There are many more direct alternatives, such as:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>we moved the field to the dust bowl because of the uneven nature of the south part of our field (20 words)</p></blockquote>

<p>or even:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>we moved the field to the dust bowl because the south part of our field is uneven (17 words)</p></blockquote>

<p>So far we've removed 6 words from a 23-word sentence. I might even go for:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>we moved the field to the dust bowl because the south field is uneven (14 words)</p></blockquote>

<p>but really, I have a problem only with "the reason ... was because."</p>

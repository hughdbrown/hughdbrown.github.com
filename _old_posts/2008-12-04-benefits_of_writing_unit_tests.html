<h1>Benefits of writing unit tests first</h1>
<ol>
<li>Unit tests prove that your code actually works</li>
<li>You get a low-level regression-test suite</li>
<li>You can improve the design without breaking it</li>
<li>It's more fun to code with them than without</li>
<li>They demonstrate concrete progress</li>
<li>Unit tests are a form of sample code</li>
<li>It forces you to plan before you code</li>
<li>It reduces the cost of bugs</li>
<li>It's even better than code inspections</li>
<li>It virtually eliminates coder's block</li>
<li>Unit tests make better designs</li>
<li>It's faster than writing code without tests</li>
</ol>

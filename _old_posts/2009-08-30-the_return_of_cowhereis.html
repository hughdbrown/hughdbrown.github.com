<p>A long time ago, I wrote CoWhereIs in C/C++. It was a small program to search the registry for where a COM server was to be found. Back in the mists of time, this was something you needed to do from time to time if you were a COM developer, as I was. And somewhere along the way, I stopped needing to do that and I lost the source code. But it was no big problem because I was no longer working with COM.</p>

<p>And now I find that I have some .NET code that implements user defined functions (UDFs) in Excel 2007 and it turns out that the integration between Excel and .NET is stuck in 2005: the code has to be exposed as a COM server that is installed with regasm on your machine. So now I need an installer and I need to test the installer to see if it is, in fact, calling regasm to patch the registry so that my .NET/COM server is actually available.</p>

<p>And so I found myself rewriting CoWhereIs to search the registry. This time, I've written it in python because the times have changed. Enjoy.</p>

<p>A mnemonic for remembering the last names of the American presidents.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Why aren't just, moral men attracting judicious voters? Historically,
the parties tried for plurality by listing jobs, growth, honest
government as candidates' highest concerns. More recently, though,
White House campaigns have refined their election knowhow: Just need
Fox channel running biased coverage -- Bingo!</p></blockquote>

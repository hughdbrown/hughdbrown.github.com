<p>From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3830521.stm">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote  class="quote"><p>The world's most difficult word to translate has been identified as "ilunga"
from the Tshiluba language spoken in south-eastern DR Congo.</p>

<p>It came top of a list drawn up in consultation with 1,000 linguists.</p>

<p><em>Ilunga</em> means "a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to
tolerate it a second time, but never a third time".</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a website dedicated to the fascinating world of mathematics and programming.<p>

<p>Lots of cool math problems. Challenges you to solve math problems, typically by writing computer programs (unless you've memorized the first one million primes -- then you could do these in your head). I've done 70 or so and am trying to stay in the top 500 problem solvers.</p>

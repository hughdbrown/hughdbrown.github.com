<p>The number of google-able spam comments I have started to get on my blog in the past two weeks suggests that the CAPTCHA from Movable Type that I use is compromised; it looks as if there is an automatic way to identify CAPTCHA images. And googling for these comments shows that many WordPress blogs are falling for this, too. I'd be interested to see comments (but not spam comments!) on this point.</p>

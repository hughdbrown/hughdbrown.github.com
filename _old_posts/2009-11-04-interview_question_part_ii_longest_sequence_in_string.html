<p>I think a better algorithm is to find the first run and then to continue the search that many characters to the right. If you've found a run of 6 characters, say, you don't have to look from characters 0 to 5 past the end of the run -- you can start 6 characters past and search left and right for a run of 7 or more. The longer the run you have already found, the faster the algorithm is on the balance because it has to do fewer searches.</p>

<p>This is basic Boyer-Moore/KMP type searching. Too bad I did not think of this in the interview.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
def search_longest_substring(s):
    def find_left(s, midc, mid, left):
        for j in range(mid-1, left-1, -1):
            if s[j] != midc:
                return j + 1
        return left
    def find_right(s, midc, mid, right):
        for k in range(mid+1, right):
            if s[k] != midc:
                return k
        return right
    i, longest = 0, (0, '')
    while i < len(s):
        c = s[i]
        j = find_left(s, c, i, i-longest[0])
        k = find_right(s, c, i, len(s))
        if k-j > longest[0]:
            longest = (k-j, c)
        i = k + longest[0]
    return longest

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print search_longest_substring("AABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDAAABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDDAAABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDA")

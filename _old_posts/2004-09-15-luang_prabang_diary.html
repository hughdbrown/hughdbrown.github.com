<h1>[<a href="http://www.nthposition.com/luangprabangdiary.php">Luang Prabang diary</a>]</h1>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Luang Prabang is a sort of Indochinese Oxford, smaller and prettier and classier than the capital. It has the culture. It preserves the identity. It
thinks well of itself. It has specialities. It remains a slightly twee but
notable relic of Asie Fran&ccedil;aise, which is nothing like the British India I'm
used to, all that sweat, duty, and cell-block architecture. The French relished
princely Luang Prabang, so poised within its confluence of rivers, so elegant,
with its pagoda roofs sweeping down like golden wings. Typically they found
Buddhism the religion smug and institutional but loved what it looked like,
that ascetic Buddhist aesthetic. They built villas and cafes to admire this
gorgeous East from; and today the monks, ever graceful in sunset orange, still
twirl their parasols along the promenade by those cafes, where French tourists
sit all afternoon in wicker chairs amidst the retro d&eacute;cor, eating
tuna-and-watercress baguettes and drinking Beer Lao from imported tumblers. For
one long lunchtime moment it's Indochine as it never was but should have been.</p></blockquote>

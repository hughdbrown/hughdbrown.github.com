I recently got these two videos from the <em>Charlie and Lola</em> series for my six year old niece:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Lola-Vol-Actually-Party/dp/B000XA5K02/">Charlie & Lola, Vol 7 - This Is Actually My Party</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Lola-Vol-Collecting-Collection/dp/B00186DF48/">Charlie and Lola, Vol. 8: I Am Collecting a Collection</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I saw it on TV first and thought it was nice. The cartoons have pleasing drawing. The plot and characters are enjoyable. I thought it was pretty cute. Hope she likes them!</p>

<p>Here are two videos of a catch made by a <a href="http://manhattanultimate.com/Summer2008/index.htm">summer league</a> teammate of mine when he played in the Ultimate Frisbee finals in 2005.</p>

</ul>

<p>You can see how he had to follow the arc of this throw while outrunning his coverage the whole time. It's amazing. I can watch these videos over and over.</p>

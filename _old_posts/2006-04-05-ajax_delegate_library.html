<blockquote class="quote"><p>The Student Academic Services at California Polytechnic have an interesting article on procrastination, discussing why we do it, how it affects us, and what we can gain from overcoming our procrastinating tendencies. They also offer a simple four-step cure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Realize you are delaying something unnecessarily. </li>
	<li>Discover the real reasons for your delay. List them. </li>
	<li>Dispute those real reasons and overcome them. Be vigorous. </li>
	<li>Begin the task. </li>
</ul>

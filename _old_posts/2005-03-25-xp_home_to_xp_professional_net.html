<p>XP Home to XP Professional networking</p>

<p>If your XP Pro machine has "Use simple file sharing" enabled, then the XP
Home machine will authenticate as guest. You don't need to enable the
guest account (in the User Accounts control panel) but you do need to edit
the local policy to allow guest to access the computer from the network.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">Local Policies-&gt;User Rights Assignment-&gt;Deny access to this computer from the network </pre>

<p>If you don't have "use simple file sharing" enabled, then the user on the
XP Home machine must have an account with the exact username and password
on the XP Pro machine for it to authenticate to.</p>

<p>Also, enabling the Guest account in the control panel enables enables local
logon for the Guest account.  I don't think it enables network logon.</p>

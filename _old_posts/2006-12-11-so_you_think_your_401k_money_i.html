<a href="http://ellistrust.com/news/Ellis_LATimesArticle.doc.pdf">So you think your 401(k) money is safe</a><br />Originally a LA Times article on the lack of federal protection for 401(k) plans, the article is no longer available at latimes.com. Link to a PDF that has the original content.<br /><br />

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Thefts from 401(k)s at large companies are practically unheard of. These plans generally are run by big investment firms whose reputations could be ruined by pilferage.</p>

<p>Employees typically choose their investments from a menu of mutual funds and can monitor their account balances around the clock.</p>

<p>It's a much different picture at many smaller companies. The plans may be overseen by the firm's owner or business manager. Employees often have no say in how their money is invested and no way to monitor their accounts. When theft occurs, it tends to happen at companies on the edge of bankruptcy. As the firms collapse, there may not be enough assets left to repay workers or enough insurance to cover their losses.</p></blockquote>

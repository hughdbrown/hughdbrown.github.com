<p>So the Windows 7 upgrade that I reported yesterday gets better. <a href="http://www.datavis.com/">DataVision</a>, the store in New York I bought the upgrade from, is totally unwilling to provide a refund or to take an exchange on the product <strong>because I opened the package.</strong> I don't know of any way to determine that an operating system will not install on your machine without actually, you know, running the installation. Their recommendation? Take it up with Microsoft. Microsoft, understandably, says, "Waaaah? We didn't sell you this. Talk to DataVision."</p>

<p>The stance of the manager, Joey (212 689 1111 x1746), is three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>You always have to reinstall your programs when you upgrade the operating system<br />Patently untrue. Not true with any previous Microsoft OS I've used and not true for any Linux OS I've tried. Some people will say anything not to have to refund money.</li>
<li>We don't refund money</li>
<li>We don't take back opened software<br />
I have no idea how I would have known the installation would fail (or require reinstalling all programs) without opening the package.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I have a suggestion of my own: don't do business with DataVision.</p>

<p>Update 2009-10-23: Maybe I should have known better. If you look for <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=8991819621108373082&q=computer%2Bstore%2Blocations%2Bnew%2Byork&hl=en&view=feature&mcsrc=detailed_reviews&num=10&start=0">ratings of DataVision on the web</a>, it's pretty consistently rated one of the worst places to get computer service in New York City.</p>

<blockquote>"They truly have the worst customer service in the world" ... "Located in midtown Manhattan, this computer store leaves much to be desired" ... "ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!" ... "The prices are pretty good" ... "Awful. I wouldnt shop there again" ... "Very helpful"</blockquote>

<p>Update 2009-11-05: Wahoo! I am number one on <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=datavision+sucks">google for the phrase 'DataVision sucks'</a>! Now there is some talented branding!</p>

<h1>Reporting software</h1>
<p>Excerpted from another email group I follow -- can't remember where I saw this.</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>I suggest using SQL Server Reporting Services and authoring all you reports in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/reporting/rdlspec.mspx">RDL format</a>. Then, if you don't like how SSRS is working, or don't like the licensing, you can pop over to <a href="http://www.fyireporting.com/">FYIReporting</a> and get their open-source version and is RDL compliant...</p></blockquote>

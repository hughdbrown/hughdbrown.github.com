<p>To calculate the Directional Movement System:<p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the Directional movement for today<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">
+DM = Today's High - Yesterday's High (when price moves upward)
-DM = Yesterday's Low - Today's Low (when price moves downward)</pre>
<p>You cannot have both +DM and -DM on the same day. If there is an outside day (where both calculations are
positive) then the larger of the two results is taken. An inside day (where both calculations are negative) will
always equal zero.</p></li>
<li>Calculate the true range for the day. True range is the largest of:<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">
Today's High - Today's Low,
Today's High - Yesterday's Close, and
Yesterday's Close - Today's Low</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
+DM14 = exponential moving average* of +DM
-DM14= exponential moving average* of -DM
TR14 = exponential moving average* of True Range</pre></li>
<li>Calculate the Directional Indicators:<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">
+DI14 = +DM14 divided by TR14
-DI14 = -DM14 divided by TR14</pre></li>
<li>Calculate the components of the Average Directional Movement Index (ADX):<br />
<ol>
<li>Calculate the DI Difference:<br />
Record the difference between +DI14 and -DI14 as a positive number.</li>
<li>Calculate the Directional Index (DX):<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">
DX = DI Difference divided by the sum of +DI14 and -DI14
ADX = the exponential moving average* of DX</pre></li>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>

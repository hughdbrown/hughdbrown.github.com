<blockquote class="quote"><p>IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.</p></blockquote></li>

<p>Python is a dynamic language, used for a wide variety of purposes, with an emphasis on clean and expressive code. It allows the maximum flexibility for the developer, whilst maintaining readability of code.</p>

<p>IronPython brings Python to .NET, and allows you native access to the .NET framework and classes. It runs on Microsoft .NET and on Mono, a cross-platform Open Source implementation of the .NET runtime and framework libraries.</p></blockquote></li>

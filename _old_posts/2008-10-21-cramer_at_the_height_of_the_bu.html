<p>Here is Jim Cramer, <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html">pumping a bunch of tech stocks on 2000-02-29</a>, just weeks before the NASDAQ topped. Here is a quote to take you back to those days:</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>It is no secret that the Dow, made up principally of companies that can't raise the bar, is down 12% while the Nasdaq, which is made up of companies that can raise the bar, is up 12%. And in the self-fulfilling jungle that is Wall Street, only growth can maintain growth!</p></blockquote>

<p>So <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=SVNX%2bARBA%2bISLD%2bEXDS%2bINSP%2bINKT%2bMERQ%2bSNRA%2bVRSN%2bVRTS">where are they now</a>? Three still trade on the NASDAQ, two are on the pink sheets, and five don't trade with these symbols -- probably out of business. ARBA trades for about 1% of its bubble-high of $1500, INSP is at 0.5% of its high of over $1500, and VRSN trades for about 10% of its high of $300.</p>

<p>What about the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=MRK%2bPFE%2bX%2bPD%2bUNP">Old Economy stocks he singles out to diss</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phelps_Dodge">Freeport-McMoRan acquired Phelps Dodge</a> in 2007 for $25.9 billion in cash and stock, so I'm just going to guess that that's a positive return. Just by eyeballing the other charts, I'd say that these are the returns over the same period:
<ul>
	<li>MRK -50%</li>
	<li>PFE -75%</li>
	<li>X +150%</li>
	<li>UNP +200%</li>
</ul>

<p>On balance, I think you'd have to be ahead with the Old Economy picks that Cramer sneered at.</p>

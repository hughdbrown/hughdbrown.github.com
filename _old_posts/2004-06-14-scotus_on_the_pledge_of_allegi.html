<p>SCOTUS turned down a non-custodial parent's suit to overturn the use of the
Pledge of Allegiance for its use of "under God" today. Rehnquist is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/14/scotus.pledge/index.html">cited here</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>In his minority opinion, Rehnquist wrote, "To give the parent of such a child a sort of 'heckler's veto' over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase 'under God,' is an unwarranted extension of the establishment clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance."</p></blockquote>

<p>So I take this to be an argument of three parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It's constitutional because it is patriotic;</li>
	<li>It's constitutional because children do it willingly;</li>
	<li>It's constitutional because the parent has no standing to bring suit.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have to say that (1) and (2) are ludicrous, and (2) particularly so. We have
a body of experts who decide constitutional matters of American law, and that
is the Supreme Court. That a justice on SCOTUS should decide to defer to the
estimates of school children as authorities on constitutionality is absurd.</p>

<p>I had hoped the Supreme Court would acquit itself more admirably than this. In
my opinion, this is a case of government endorsement of religion, but if SCOTUS
is going to dismiss the case, at Least it could come up with better reasons
than these.</p>

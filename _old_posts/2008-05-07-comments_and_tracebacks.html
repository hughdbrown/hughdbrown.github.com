I'm sure this will be hard to understand, but I am still working on getting comments and tracebacks working. I wrestled with getting Image::Magick installed; no luck. Then I worked on getting reCaptcha installed just so I could have some captcha provider in my list. That was impeded by my FTP client hanging up, but once I restarted that, it was fine. So now I don't know what the problem is:<br /><ul><li>reCaptcha is listed as a plugin</li><li>reCaptcha is selected as my CAPTCHA provider</li><li>Comments are set to <i>Immediate approve comments from: Anyone</i></li><li>Registration is set to <i>Anonymous comments</i> with <i>Require E-mail Address for Anonymous Comments</i> set</li><li>Web Services setting has a Type Key value obtained from SixApart</li><li>Entire website has been rebuilt</li><li>I've followed all the instructions on <a href="http://joshcarter.com/software/recaptcha">Adding reCAPTCHA to Movable Type</a><br /></li></ul>You'd think it would be fine. So I'll be waiting here for someone to post a comment on how to fix this -- no wait.

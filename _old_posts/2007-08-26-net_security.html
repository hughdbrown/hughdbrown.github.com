<blockquote class="quote"><p>"You might use imperative syntax for demands and overrides instead of declarative syntax when information that you need in order to initialize the permission state becomes known only at run time. For example, if you want to ensure that callers have permission to read a certain file, but you do not know the name of that file until run time, use an imperative demand. You might also choose to use imperative checks instead of declarative checks when you need to determine at run time whether a condition holds and, based on the result of the test, make a security demand (or not)."</p></blockquote>

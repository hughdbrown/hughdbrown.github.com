<p>Update 2008-08-06: Alexander Elder also has a service called <a href="http://www.elder.com/spike.html">Spike Spectators' Group</a> which allows investors and traders to subscribe to other traders' stock picks:</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>
Traders often ask: 'How do you find stocks to trade?'
Many pros spend hours each week scanning databases, looking for attractive candidates. This is similar to mining - tunneling through thick layers of useless rock to find a relatively small quantity of rich ore.</p>

<p>This homework is essential for successful trading, but it takes a great deal of time and energy. Now, for a relatively small fee, you can have rich ore delivered to you. You can have a steady flow of intelligent picks from a group of professional and semi-professional traders, each of whom spends hours looking for stocks and most of whom trade their own and their colleagues' picks. Now, instead of looking for stocks, you can review more than a dozen attractive picks each week to see which of them work best with your own trading system.</p></blockquote>

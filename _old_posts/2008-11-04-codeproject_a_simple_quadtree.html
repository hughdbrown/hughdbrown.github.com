<h1><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/QuadTree.aspx">A simple QuadTree implementation in C#</a></h1>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>A QuadTree is a spatial partitioning strategy used to make queries on relationships between 2D spatial data such as coordinates in a Geographic Information System (GIS), or the location of objects in a video game. For instance, you may need to know all of the objects within a region on a map, test weather objects are visible by a camera, or optimize a collision detection algorithm.</p>

<p>The QuadTree is so named because it recursively partitions regions into four parts, with leaf nodes containing references to the spatial objects. Querying the QuadTree is a function of traversing the tree nodes that intersect the query area.</p>

<p>The OctTree is the analogous structure used for 3 dimensional problems. </p></blockquote>

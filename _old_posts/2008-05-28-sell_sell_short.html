I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470181672/tag=iwebtherefore-20"><em>Sell &amp; Sell Short</em></a> at Barnes and Noble the other day. Naturally, I returned home and ordered it from Amazon.<p>

<p>I've shorted a couple of times, but I think that I have to do it more often to make money in all markets. There aren't a lot of good books out there on shorting, so I am looking forward to working through this.</p>

<p>Here are some topics covered in the book:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How to control risk by linking the placement of your protective stop with your money management and position size</li>
	<li>Where not to put your protective stops</li>
	<li>Why using moving averages as profit targets works well in the early stages of an upmove</li>
	<li>Why channels or envelopes are better targets when you are riding a trending stock</li>
	<li>How to use support/resistance areas for profit targets and stop losses in long-term position trades</li>
	<li>How to adjust your targets when market conditions change or your stock blows through the initial profit target</li>
</ul>

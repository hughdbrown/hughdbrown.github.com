<p>Barron's has a really nice page for <a href="http://online.barrons.com/data/?refresh=on">market data</a>. In addition to the front page with index levels and market summaries, it has US stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, credit market data, currencies, futures, and calendars (including IPOs and earnings).</p>

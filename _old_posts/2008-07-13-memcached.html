<h1><a href="http://danga.com/memcached/">MemCached</a></h1>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.</p>

<p>Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>C#/.NET memcached client library. This library can be used by .NET projects to access memcached servers. Ported from the Java memcached library located at <a href="http://www.whalin.com/memcached/">http://www.whalin.com/memcached/</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow. All you had to do with GM for the past couple of months was to short at the open and cover at the close. You'd have made 30% in September, 208% in October, and 33% so far in November. And GM is down from $5.00 at the open to $4.22 today. That's an extra 15%. If you didn't wait for the close, you'd be up 53% this month. On one trade per day.</p>

<p>Of course, you'd have to have really believed in this trade to have carried it out for all of September. There was a 25% drawdown until the 19th of September followed by +69% until the end of the month.</p>

<h1>[<a href="http://www.code4ward.net/CS2/">Royal TS: Easy Remote Desktop Connections</a></h1>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Royal TS allows you to organize and manage multiple remote desktop connections. Connect to any machine where terminal services are enabled. Organize connections in custom categories for quick access. Connect directly to the console session and find out who else is connected to the machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last night, I bought <a href="http://www.technicalanalysisbook.com/">this book</a>. There are several very positive <a href="http://www.technicalanalysisbook.com/reviews/">reviews of the book</a> from Brett Steenbarger and Charles Kirk, two traders I really respect:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>In <i>Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes</i>, Brian Shannon takes the reader through the essentials of technical analysis and then illustrates how to integrate those into a coherent trading methodology. From the phases of stock movement to price/volume relationships and risk management, Brian brings his topics to life with concrete and practical illustrations and explanations. This is an excellent resource for all technically-oriented traders; anyone who has enjoyed Brian's video insights on the Alpha Trends blog will surely appreciate the way he synthesizes those lessons in this book.</p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>When Brian contacted me awhile back to read and provide a review of his new book <i>Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes</i>, I couldn't have been more excited. Brian has been blogging about stocks for a long time and his video chart presentations are a unique offering that many find useful. His intense passion for the market and deep love of the game itself is evident in everything Brian does and shares with his readers.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Brian's book is an excellent resource because he is great instructor. Unlike many books on trading written by traders who frankly have a difficult time explaining their methods, Brian shows his skills by breaking down relatively complex ideas in a straightforward manner. Ultimately this makes his book particularly good for traders who are just starting out on the learning curve and those who've found other trading books too complex or difficult to implement in the real world.</p>

<p>I hadn't heard of Brian Shannon before but I am really looking forward to getting my hands on this book.</p>

Technically, I think that <a href="http://www.racingtheplanet.com/">Racing the Planet</a>'s <a href="http://www.4deserts.com/gobimarch/">Gobi March</a> actually occurs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taklamakan">Taklamakan Desert</a>, not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi">Gobi Desert</a>. The Taklamakan is bounded by "the Kunlun Mountains to the south [the border range of northern Tibet], and Pamir Mountains [which cut north through Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, touching western China] and Tian Shan [Tajikistan as far east as Urumqi]...to the west and north". The Taklamakan comprises most of the area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Basin">Tarim Basin</a>.<p>

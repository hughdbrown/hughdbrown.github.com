<p>I interviewed at <a href="http://www.bluemountaincapital.com/index.htm">BlueMountain Capital Management</a>. Not my worst interview ever, but I was really out of practice.</p>

<p>Questions included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design a library lending system</li>
	<li>What are weak references?</li>
	<li>What is a hashtable? Can any object be a key? Can any object be a value? Can a mutable object be the key?</li>
	<li>What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in C#?</li>
	<li>Calculate the recovery rate for a CDS at par with one period remaining.</li>
        <li>Implement a deep copy routine for an object that may have cycles or self-reference.</li>
        <li>Write a routine to calculate the minimum depth of a leaf node in a binary tree.</li>
        <li>What is the complexity of a hashtable search? What is the complexity in the degenerate case?</li>
</ul>

<p>I met with Steve, Axel, and Perry Vais.</p>

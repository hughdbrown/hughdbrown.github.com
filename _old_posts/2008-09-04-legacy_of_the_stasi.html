<p>The Stasi, the state police of East Germany, kept extensive files on citiizens, totalling an estimated 1 billion pages.

Not all of the documents were disposed of, though, and now the hand-torn pages are being digitally reassembled using paper scanners and computer programs to logically stitch the pages together.</p>

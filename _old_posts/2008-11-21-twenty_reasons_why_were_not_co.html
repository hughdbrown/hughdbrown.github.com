<p>Nouriel Roubini (<a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/">blog: Roubini Global Economonitor</a>) has a great <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/11/19/consumer-debt-savings-oped-cx_nr_1120roubini.html?partner=daily_newsletter">article in Forbes online</a> on why the recession is not going away anytime soon. The short answer: No savings and a pile of debt.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"<p>This week's news about October retail sales (-2.8% relative to the previous month and now down in real terms for five months in a row) confirm that the U.S. has entered its most severe consumer-led recession in decades. At this rate of free fall in consumption, real gross domestic product growth could be a whopping 5% negative or even worse in the fourth quarter of 2008. And this is not a temporary phenomenon: Almost all of the fundamentals driving consumption are heading south on a persistent and structural basis.</p></blockquote>

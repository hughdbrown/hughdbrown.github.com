<h1>Getting rich</h1>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>If you want to make a lot of money, don't make money your goal. Make serving a lot of people your goal. If you hit that target enough times, you'll get your reward. That reward will be money, and you can do whatever you choose with that money.</p>

<p>But remember that money is only the reward for hitting your target - it's not the target itself. Always keep your priorities straight.</p></blockquote>

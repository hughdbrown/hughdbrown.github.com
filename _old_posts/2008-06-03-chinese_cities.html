<p>So Lori is in western China, having passed through Urumqi (a city of 2 000 000-ish) to Kashgar (a city of 200 000-ish).</p>

<p>The number of Chinese cities with populations above 1 000 000 is pretty staggering -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_by_population">58 in all</a>. For comparison, the US has only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population">9 cities with a population over 1 000 000</a>. If Urumqi, ranked 33 by population in China, were in the US, it would nudge out Phoenix for 5<sup>th</sup> place.</p>

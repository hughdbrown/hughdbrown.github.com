<p>I'm embarrassed to say that <a href="http://armorgames.com/play/1760/hedgehog-launch">this game</a> is actually fun to play. The premise: a country's space program is going to be based on launching hedgehogs (optionally equipped with jetpacks, parachutes, and radar) into the air using rubber bands and launchpads.</p>

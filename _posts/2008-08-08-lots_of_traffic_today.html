<p>So today I got more hits than in all of May 2008. It's really not clear where the traffic is going (since I don't have access to the raw logs) nor where it came from. I can say that the IP addresses are from everywhere: India, Japan, Australia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, France, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Hungary, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Spain, Finland, Israel, Guam, South Africa, Jamaica, and Romania. You know -- everywhere.</p>

<p>I suppose I'll figure it out in awhile. IWeb will show up in google as linked to something interesting that will explain it, like slashdot or something.</p>

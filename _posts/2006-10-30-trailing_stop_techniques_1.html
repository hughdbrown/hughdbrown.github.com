<p>The article outlines the basic use of trailing stops:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The most basic technique for establishing an appropriate exit point is the trailing-stop technique. Very simply, the trailing stop maintains a stop-loss order at a precise percentage below the market price (or above, in the case of a short position). The stop-loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price, always maintaining the same percentage below (or above) the market price. The trader is then "guaranteed" to know the exact minimum profit that his or her position will garner. This level of profitability the trader will have previously determined based on his or her predilection toward
aggressive or conservative trading.</p></blockquote>

<p>and then describes methods of determining where to set the stop.</p>

<p>Recruiters</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manish Sharma<br />
10:40 Position we were looking at (C#/Java) is on hold -- not hiring in this economy. No positions suitable. Offered to help me with job search. I am calling him back in the afternoon to discuss strategy/approach.</li>
	<li>Beth Akin<br />
9:30 Left message for her to call.<br />
10:15 Sent list of current Credit Suisse positions that would be good.<br />
13:50 Called Beth, didn't connect. She got my email and is looking into the opportunities I listed.</li>

	<li>Eric Ross<br />
10:50 Called Eric Ross. No C# positions, most .NET hiring is in hedge funds. Slow, bare bones hiring, end of summer.<br />
His recommendations: contact past managers and consider looking outside finance.</li>

	<li>John Keenan (Continuity Partners)<br />
<p>Looked at his website and saw two positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# / .Net developer<br />
open since 2007-08-20</li>

<li>Software Engineer<br />
Job Code: #1014<br />
Title: C++ - Intermediate - Credit Risk - 52574<br />
Date Posted: 08/20/2008</li>
</ul>

<p>Called him at 14:00 and I asked about the second position. It's at Morgan Stanley using unix. We talked about whether is is worthwhile for me to get into unix. He thinks not -- employers are going to be selective now and not willing to take lower ability. He thinks I am going to get hired in Visual C++ or .NET/C#</p>

<p>He asked if I was being represented at Credit Suisse and Barclay's because he figures they do the most .NET.</p>

<p>He recommended that I look at a job search engine called indeed.com because it is an aggregator that has contract work. He thinks that looking for contract work is more likely than fulltime.</p>

</ul>

<p>Job search sites</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Daily WTF<br />
Only open position is with BridgeWater. I've interviewed there and they were not really receptive.</li>
</ul>

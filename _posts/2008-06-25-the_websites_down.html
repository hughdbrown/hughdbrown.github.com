<p>This is a video with sound of an <a href="http://www.thewebsiteisdown.com/salesguy.html">internal systems support guy's fictional morning</a>. It is so funny. Comic gold:</p>
<ul>
	<li>remote desktop'ing into a salesguy's machine to discover that all the icons on his desktop form a penis outline</li>
	<li>deleting boss's email from his sent mail to support denial of never having seen the message</li>
	<li>attacking coworkers in Halo game</li>
</ul>

Barbecuing is occasionally complicated by unreliable charcoal bricks. Sometimes they don't start even when you douse them with that nasty kerosene fire starter. I'm expecting that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weber-87886-Chimney-Starter/dp/B00004U9VV/ref=nosim/iwebtherefore-20">this low-tech solution from Weber</a> will work better. It's basically a custom-made chimney for igniting charcoal bricks. The coals draw air from the bottom and the fire spreads up the chimney.</p>

<p>2008-07-17: I've been using this product for two months now and I have a few comments to add:<ul>
<li>No liquid fire starter required<br />
Or recommended.</li>
<li>Intensity<br />
Within a short period, the fire is consistently red-hot. The coals are amazingly hot throughout.</li>
<li>Ease of starting<br />
Every time I have used this, I've had one-match fires. Just one match was needed to get it started. You put two sheets of newspaper in the bottom and that's enough to get the coals started.</li>
</ul>

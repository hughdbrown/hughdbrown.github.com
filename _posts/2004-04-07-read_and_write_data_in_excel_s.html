<pre class="prettyprint">
oConn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" &amp; _
           "Data Source=c:\somepath\mySpreadsheet.xls;" &amp; _
           "Extended Properties=""Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes"""</pre>
<p>Where "HDR=Yes" means that there is a header row in the cell range (or named range), so the provider will not include the first row of the selection into the recordset.  If "HDR=No", then the provider will include the first row of the cell range (or named ranged) into the recordset.</p>

<p>How do you find out which year is best for a particular region? I've found that California wines from 2002 and 2004 are really great, but I have no information or insight into other regions.</p>

<p>For example, Lori and I recently opened an Australian table wine that turned out to be quite good. It was <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/Excelsior/2006/USA-/USD/A/-/0">Black Swan Shiraz 2006</a>. I'd be interested in knowing if there was a really good year for this wine.</p>

<p>Also, on election night, we had a South African wine, <a href="http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/Excelsior/2006/USA-/USD/A/-/0">Excelsior Cabernet-Sauvignon 2006</a>. Also unknown to me what would be a great year for this.</p>

<p>BTW, both of these wines are about $6-7 per bottle, making them great choices for regular drinking.</p>

<p>Update 2008-11-06: My sister-in-law suggested the <a href="http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine_Picks/0,3657,,00.html">Wine Spectator daily picks</a>, and each of the wines I mentioned, albeit in a different year, has been featured in Wine Spectator as an Under $15 Daily Pick:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine/0,1142,4664,00.html">BLACK SWAN Shiraz-Cabernet</a>
	<p>South Eastern Australia 2005 (85 points, $8)</p></li>

	<li><a href="http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine/0,1142,1470,00.html">EXCELSIOR  Cabernet Sauvignon</a>
	<p>Robertson 2002 (87 points, $8)</p></li>
</ul>

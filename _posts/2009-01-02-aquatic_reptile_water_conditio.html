<p><img align="right" src="http://www.zilla-rules.com/assets/003/9562_200wh.jpg" />Recently, I wanted a product to take the chlorine out of swimwear. The products on offer were fairly expensive -- typically $5 (plus shipping and handling) for a 2 ounce bottle of dechlorinator. But I discovered that the mystery ingredient is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiosulfate">sodium thiosulfate</a>, so it was a simple matter to find some other product that uses the same ingredient.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it is also used as a dechlorinator for water for pets, and the cheapest source is R-Zilla's <a href="http://www.zilla-rules.com/products/aquatic-reptile-water-conditioner.htm">Aquatic Reptile Water Conditioner</a> which costs $10 for 8 ounces at my local petstore. So now I am using this to take the chlorine out of my swimsuit.</p>

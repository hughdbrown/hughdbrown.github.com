<p>Excerpts from <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">How Not to Talk to Your Kids</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p>[...] those who think that innate intelligence is the key to success begin to discount the importance of effort. I am smart, the kids' reasoning goes; I don't need to put out effort. Expending effort becomes stigmatized-it's public proof that you can't cut it on your natural gifts.</p>

<p>In the opinion of cognitive scientist Daniel T. Willingham, a teacher who praises a child may be unwittingly sending the message that the student [has] reached the limit of his innate ability, while a teacher who criticizes a pupil conveys the message that he can improve his performance even further.</p>

<p>Students turn to cheating because they haven't developed a strategy for handling failure.</p>

<ul>
<li> Don't tell them they are smart... tell them they worked hard.</li>
<li>Don't praise them for being good at something... tell them they are getting better through practice.</li>
<li>Don't tell them they are bad at something... tell them how to do it right.</li>

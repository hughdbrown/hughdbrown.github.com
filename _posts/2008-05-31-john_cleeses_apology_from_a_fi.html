<p>This is what a <a href="/sounds/FW-apology.wav">real apology should sound like</a>. Of course, Otto has the advantage here of hanging Archie out a window by his ankles at the time, and not everyone will have this edge when requesting an apology.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>Archie: All right, all right, I apologize.</p>
<p>Otto: You're really sorry?</p>
<p>Archie: I'm really, really, sorry. I apologize unreservedly.</p>
<p>Otto: You take it back?</p>
<p>Archie: I do, I offer a complete and utter retraction. The imputation was totally without basis in fact, and was in no way fair comment, and was motivated purely by malice. And I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you, or your family, and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Otto: Ok.</p>
</blockquote>

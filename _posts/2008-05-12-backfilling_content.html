<p>So I've finally backfilled content from early 2004 to the present. I eventually did get all my content out of notepad.yahoo.com, format it as a Movable Type import file (including getting the separators, date format, and unix newlines correct), and uploaded it to my blog.</p>

<p>Of course, the content is pretty poorly formatted, so it will be months before I have it in a truly usable format. Until then, it's all here.</p>

<p>I've been following the ultimate frisbee championships in Vancouver off and on over the internet. Partly I was interested because I play frisbee, partly because a friend, <a href="http://www.pbase.com/cmberghout/image/101408904">Arnold</a> <a href="http://www.pbase.com/cmberghout/image/101408919">Sanchez</a>, was playing for the USA Masters team, and partly because it was in Canada. The level of play looked pretty high, but it quickly became obvious that the teams from Canada, USA, Japan, and Australia were the ones to beat. They dominated in all divisions.</p>

<p>Final results:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/masters">Masters</a>: USA over Canada</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/open">Open</a>: Canada over USA</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/women">Women</a>: USA over Japan</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/mixed">Mixed</a>: Canada over Japan</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/jr-open">Junior open</a>: USA over Canada</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wugc2008.com/standings/div/jr-women">Junior women</a>: Japan over Australia</li>
</ul>

<p>I have got to get a camera that can do <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ijkerr/sets/72157606625652945/show/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Finnair advertised today in amNewYork that it had fares to Asia: Seoul, Beijing, and Shanghai for $848; Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya for $948. Let's leave out for a minute that you can't see these fares listed on their <a href="http://www.finnair.com/us/">site</a>. I find it fascinating that Finnair is flying people from New York to Asia via Helsinki:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">Now you can fly Finnair's brand new aircraft from New York (JFK) via Helsinki (HEL) to Asia at a very good price.</blockquote>

<p>Isn't it a lot farther this way? Concretely, how far is it from JFK to TYO via HEL versus the direct route? Fortunately, the web has the answer. Using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circle</a>, the most direct route on our ovoid planet, <a href="http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=JFK-HEL-TYO%0D%0A&RANGE=&PATH-COLOR=red&PATH-UNITS=mi&PATH-MINIMUM=&SPEED-GROUND=&SPEED-UNITS=kts&RANGE-STYLE=best&RANGE-COLOR=navy&MAP-STYLE=">JFK-HEL-TYO</a> is 8981 miles. <a href="http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=JFK-TYO%0D%0A&RANGE=&PATH-COLOR=red&PATH-UNITS=mi&PATH-MINIMUM=&SPEED-GROUND=&SPEED-UNITS=kts&RANGE-STYLE=best&RANGE-COLOR=navy&MAP-STYLE=">JFK-TYO</a> is 6763 miles. So the Finnair route is about one-third longer. I guess that's good if you are accumulating air miles.</p>

<p>And how long does this actually take? I went to Sidestep.com to look up a hypothetical JFK-TYO flight leaving 2009-06-23 and returning 2009-06-30. Northwest quotes a JFK-NRT return flight for $848 that takes 14:10 outbound and 12:40 on the return. Finnair's flight leaves JFK at 17:40 and arrives at HEL at 08:50 the next day. I think that's 15 hours less 6 hours for timezones or 9 hours. Then there is an 8:30 layover before the flight leaves HEL at 17:20 and arrives at NRT at 08:55 the following day. I'm not certain of the math, but it sounds like you could:</p>
<ul>
	<li>take Northwest and leave JFK at 13:50 and arrive at NRT at 17:00+1 day or</li>
	<li>take Finnair and leave JFK at 17:40 and arrive at NRT at 08:55+2 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>So on Finnair, you leave 4 hours later and arrive 16 hours later, for a trip that is 12 hours longer: 26 hours on Finnair versus 14 hours on Northwest.</p>

<p>And it's cheaper on Northwest anyway: Northwest for $848 versus Finnair for the advertised price of $948 or the Finnair.com's current price of $1178.</p>

<p>So on cost, time, and distance, this is a non-starter. It just doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

<p>My friend Michael Chepovetsky forwarded me <a href="http://www.chepovetsky.com/pr/mov/RussianTunnelofDeath.wmv">this video link</a> from inside an underground roadway in Russia with this explanation:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The 3150 meter Lefortovo Tunnel  in Russia is the longest in-city tunnel in the world. It is nicknamed <i>The Tunnel of Death</i>. See for yourself why. There is a river running over the tunnel and water leaks through in some areas. When the temperature reaches nearly 0Â°C (as it does during winter in Russia), and the road freezes. The result is the attached video which were taken during a single day with the tunnel's surveillance camera.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the dual-carriage bus driver - imagine the passengers in
the back! What a ride! The next time you complain about traffic, remember
this video... Russian Engineering!</p></blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefortovo_tunnel">wikipedia</a>, the video is a compilation and not necessarily over a single day. Still.</p>

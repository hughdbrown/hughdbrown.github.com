<blockquote class="quote"><em><p>Vice President Dick Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, in a confrontation on the Senate floor while members were having their annual
group picture taken earlier this week. . . . According to [an] aide, Mr. Cheney
. . . responded with a barnyard epithet, urging Mr. Leahy to perform an
anatomical sexual impossibility.</p></em>
<p>--The Washington Times.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote class="quote"><p>After Mr. Cheney successfully delivered the epithet and started to walk away, Mr. Leahy--sotto voce--referred to the Vice-President using a term more often
heard in taverns and locker rooms than in the august Senate chamber, a term
that refers to a sexual act commonly acknowledged as taboo among all cultures
that proscribe incestuous contact between a mother and a son.</p>

<p>Mr. Cheney--apparently hearing Mr. Leahy's remark--stopped, turned, and invited
his colleague from across the aisle to engage in a sexual act that is
considered a felony in some states, and which involves oral-genital contact.</p>

<p>Mr. Leahy then suggested that the president of the Senate take his gavel and
use it to perform an act that, while not technically impossible in anatomical
terms, would certainly be considered both unseemly and unhygienic, and which
would require an unusual combination of single-minded ambition and physical
relaxation.</p>

<p>Mr. Cheney wasted no time in informing Mr. Leahy that he should feel free to
perform yet another anatomical impossibility--this one involving aviation, a
standard sexual act, and a rolling doughnut.</p>

<p>At this point, according to observers, both statesmen decided--by seemingly
unspoken mutual consent--to abandon the gutter patois of the common carnival
worker and to resort instead to an eminently more quotable (but, to those not
versed in the vagaries of hip-hop idiom, more confusing) exchange of
viewpoints.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's like that?" Mr. Cheney queried.</p>

<p>"Whut? Whut?" Mr. Leahy shot back.</p>

<p>"Once again," Mr. Cheney replied (quite obviously quoting a lyric from Ice
Cube's 1990 album, "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted"), "it's on."</p>

<p>As a quick-thinking senatorial aide switched on the Senate's public-address
system and cued up the infamous "Seven Minutes of Funk" break, Mr. Leahy and
Mr. Cheney went head-to-head in what can only be described as a "take no
prisoners" freestyle rap battle.</p>

<p>Most of the rhymes kicked therein cannot be quoted in a family publication, but
observers gave Mr. Cheney credit for his deceptively laid-back flow. Mr. Leahy
was applauded for managing to rhyme the phrases "unethical for certain," "crude
oil spurtin'," and "like Halliburton."</p>

<p>Despite the fact that both participants brought their A-game and succeeded in
dropping mad scientifics, the bout seemed to end in a draw.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as other senators (along with assorted aides and support-staff
members) were casting their votes to decide the winner, using the admittedly
subjective but generally accepted "Make some noise up in here!" protocols, Mr.
Cheney and Mr. Leahy took the proceedings to what one aide accurately described
as "the next level."</p>

<p>Edward M. Kennedy (D.-Mass.) was the first to notice that the two men were
circling each other, Mr. Cheney brandishing a switchblade and Mr. Leahy the
jagged neck of a broken bottle.</p>

<p>"Oh, snap!" Mr. Kennedy recalls thinking at the time. "It's getting kind of
hectic up in this piece."</p>

<p>But before either of the aggrieved public servants could bust a potentially
injurious move on his rival, cooler heads prevailed: a veteran Capitol Hill
security guard pacified the bloodthirsty white men (Mr. Leahy first, then Mr.
Cheney) with a shot from a tranquillizer gun. He then had them returned to
their cages in the sub-basement of the Old Executive Office Building, where
both men are kept and fed during non-business hours under the watchful eye of a
volunteer from Washington's National Zoo.</p>

<p>(In a related story, an AM talk-radio host in Billings, Montana, who expressed
his disappointment with the behavior of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Leahy--on the air, he
asked his listeners, "Do we taxpayers really have time for this kind of
crap?"--was fined five hundred thousand dollars for violating the F.C.C.'s
recent, Senate-approved guidelines prohibiting explicit references to human
excrement.) </p></blockquote>

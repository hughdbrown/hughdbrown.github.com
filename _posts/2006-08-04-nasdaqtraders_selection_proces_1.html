<p>I receive more emails and comments about this topic then almost anything else, so I decided to lay a bunch of it out. This is the basics of my stock picking process below.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the trend of the market, is it up, down, or sideways. Always determine that first. Learned from the great Jesse Livermore</li>
<li>What are the strongest sectors or weakest depending on the trend of the markets. When you are trying to decide what stocks to be in during bull phases or bear phases go where the action is.</li>
<li>Once you identify the best target sectors now drill down and find the best stocks. This is where the charts come into play. Look for the best looking charts in a strong or weak sector depending on market conditions. Now for the really good stuff, I will list the keys to finding the silver bullet in stocks.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Moving averages. The first thing I look at is the simple moving averages. I use a few different time frames for this. I do this to identify if the stock is trending with the market/sector or against it. Is the stock strong i.e. above the 50/200 sma.</li>
<li>I then look for trendline patterns. Is the stock above major trendlines or below it. Is there any pattern that I can easily see.</li>
<li>Volume patterns is next</li>
<li>Stochastic patterns for entry and exit points</li>
<li>I love stocks with small floats. Supply will out strip demand when things go your way</li>
<li>If I am looking to go long short interest on the stock is vital. Short interest is fuel</li>
<li>Market psychology</li>
</ol>

<p>I am only touching on this stuff briefly but I hope it gives my readers some insight into what I do when looking for stocks. Good luck trading.</p>

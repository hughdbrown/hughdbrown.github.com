<p>Probably a big mistake. I can't see any published pages anymore. If you are reading this, though, then I've solved the problem.</p>

<p>I ended up installing a lot of Perl packages to get things working:</p>
<ul>
	<li>version</li>
	<li>Text::Balance</li>
	<li>IO::Compress::Zlib</li>
	<li>IO::Compress::Base</li>
	<li>Compress::Raw::Zlib</li>
</ul>
The compression ones were in the forlorn hope that I would be able to get backups with compression working. No joy.</p>

<p>Wow. Now publishing my website (say, after a style change) takes <em>hours</em>.</p>

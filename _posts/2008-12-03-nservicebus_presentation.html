<p>I came across a <a href="http://gojko.net/2008/12/02/asynchronous-net-applications-with-nservicebus/">presentation</a> on <a href="http://www.nservicebus.com/">NServiceBus</a>. I really want to do some coding that uses a publish/subscribe framework like this, so this may be a good starting point.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>NServiceBus is an open source communications framework that makes building enterprise .NET systems easier. By providing scalability critical features like publish/subscribe support, integrated long-running transactions/sagas, and deep extensibility NServiceBus provides a solid foundation for any distributed system.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/7028/">Man vs. bear</a></h1>

<p>In spirit, this is what every internet forum post is like. One of the funniest things I've ever seen on the internet:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Could a typical young man, armed only with a knife, (say, six or eight inches long) be trained to consistently "win" fights with a grizzly bear? Assume no element of surprise.</p></blockquote>

<p>Includes this award-winning response:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>In the meantime your knife will probably break. Or worse yet, get stuck. Have you ever felt bear hide? Counting in the thick fur I suspect most blows would
glance off. Remember that the bear is moving very fast. And all it needs to do
is tag you once and you're toast.</p></blockquote>

<p>and this counter-response:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>I'm talking serious ninja-level combat reflexes here, though. You're probably thinking of just Secret Agent level reflexes. Step it up another notch. I'm
imagining the guy is all wall-jumping off trees and doing scissor-kicks and
stuff.</p></blockquote>

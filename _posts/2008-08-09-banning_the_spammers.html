<p>I am getting really tired of the trackback spam. I was looking around in my MySQL administrator and found the tables that Movable Type uses to track tentative trackbacks (mt_tbping) and banned IP addresses (mt_ipbanlist). I wrote up a little SQL to copy IP addresses from unapproved trackback locations to the banned list:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">INSERT INTO mt_ipbanlist
(ipbanlist_blog_id, ipbanlist_ip)
SELECT MY_BLOG_ID, tbping_ip
FROM mt_tbping
WHERE tbping_ip <> 'MY_HOST_IP_ADDRESS'
AND tbping_ip NOT IN (
	SELECT ipbanlist_ip 
	FROM mt_ipbanlist
	WHERE ipbanlist_blog_id = MY_BLOG_ID)</pre>

<p>Of course, I'll have to check that all unapproved trackbacks are spam first, but I am hoping that the volume drops in time.</p>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>2008-08-13: added <a href="/files/mt-ipbanlist.txt">my list of banned IP addresses</a>, trackback spammers one and all.</p>

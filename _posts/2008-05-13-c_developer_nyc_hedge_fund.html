<p>Highly Successful New York City Hedge Fund seeks an outstanding C#/.NET developer to work on Enterprise trading applications and market data systems. Prior financial experience is required.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 4+ years experience designing and implementing web-based applications</li></ul>
<p>HDB: the web-based applications experience requirement disqualifies me. This is the only C# developer position that Hudson has in New York, so I can see why <a href="http://iwebthereforeiam.com/jobs/2008/05/#001586">Manny Thandi</a> is not calling back. They have only 12 development positions going back to mid-March.</p>

<p>There is a really <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9033/hidden-features-of-c">good post at StackOverflow.com</a> called <em>The Hidden Features of C#</em> that asks, "[W]hat are the most hidden features or tricks of c# that even c# fans, addicts, experts barely know?" And lots of the answers provided were unknown to me.</p>

<p>Here are some favorite points:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/concurrency/default.aspx">Parallel Computing</a><br />
"Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform (PCP) team [...] enables the shift to modern, multi- and manycore hardware, by providing a runtime that provides core support for parallelism and resource management, programming models, libraries, and tools that make it easy for developers to construct correct, efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel programs."</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/linqbridge.html">LINQBridge</a><br />
"With Studio's multi-targeting and LINQBridge, you'll be able to write local (LINQ to Objects) queries using the full power of the C# 3.0 compiler--and yet your programs will require only Framework 2.0."</li>
</ul>

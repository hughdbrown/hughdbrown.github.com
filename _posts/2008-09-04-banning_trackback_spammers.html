<p>So recently I started moving IP addresses found in Movable Type's <em>mt_tbping</em> table to <em>mt_ipbanlist</em>, with the view to turning the trackback spammers invisible. As I understand it, IP addresses found in <em>mt_ipbanlist</em> are sent away with a 403 error or otherwise do not show up in the traffic log. I found a list of banned IP addresses online and added them to my <em>mt_ipbanlist</em> table. Now I have over 26 000 banned IP addresses and yet I still get about 5 spammy trackbacks per day. How many spammers are out there?</p>

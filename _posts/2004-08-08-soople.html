<a href="http://www.soople.com/">Soople</a> is a frontend to google queries. It exposes all the really cool things you can do with google that you'd never guess. Like, did you know that you can use google to look for movie reviews. I didn't. Or to search the news for a specific topic? Or to look up definitions? (I knew this last one but had forgotten about it.)<br />

<h1><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/224689/transactions-in-net">Transactions in .net</a></h1>
<p>Answer to a question from StackOverflow:</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>What are the best practices to do transactions in C# .Net 2.0. What are the classes that should be used? What are the pitfalls to look out for etc. All that commit and rollback stuff.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a href="http://www.codeguru.com/columns/vb/article.php/c11067">The TransactionScope Object Makes ADO.NET Transactions Easy</a></h1>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>This article shows you how easy it is to use transactions with previous versions of .NET, and how you can use the TransactionScope object to auto-enlist database operations in a transaction. Other kinds of things, such as COM+ objects, can participate in transactions as well, but this article focuses on ADO.NET transactions.</p></blockquote>

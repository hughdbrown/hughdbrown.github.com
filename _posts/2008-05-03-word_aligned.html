<p>This is a recent favorite weblog. I first found it when I was looking up the <a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/the-maximum-subsequence-problem">maximum subsequence problem</a> -- how to find the longest positive run from a series of positive and negative numbers. It's the sort of thing you'd be interested in if you were checking portfolio returns.</p>

<p>I learn a lot every time I go to this site, particularly about coding in python. I really liked recent entries on itertools.groupby():</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">import itertools
import operator

city_list = [('Decatur', 'AL'), ('Huntsville', 'AL'), ('Selma', 'AL'), ('Anchorage', 'AK'), ('Nome', 'AK'),
 ('Flagstaff', 'AZ'), ('Phoenix', 'AZ'), ('Tucson', 'AZ')]

a = itertools.groupby(city_list, operator.itemgetter(1))

print [ (state, ",".join(i[0] for i in it)) for s ]</pre>

<p>Some favorite articles:</p>

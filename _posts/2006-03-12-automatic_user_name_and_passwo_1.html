<p>HDB: This is lifted from some newsgroup. I can't remember where.</p>

<p>It would depend on how authentication is implemented on that site.  If it
is a custom authentication scheme you'll probably have to POST the
username and password to a "login" page then keep track of a session
variable to use on every subsequent Navigate.</p>

<p>If it's http authentication then you could pass the username and password
in the URI: http://username:password@host/file.htm.  Which can be done
easily with the UriBuilder class.  But, that's slowly becoming deprecated
for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Alternatively, with HTTP basic authentication, you just pass an added HTTP
header entry for the username and password (encoded in base64), which can
be done with a couple of the WebBrowser.Navigate overrides.  For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
String base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(ASCIIEncoding.
  ASCII.GetBytes("username:password"));
String auth = String.Format(
  "Authorization: Basic {0}\r\n",
  base64);
byte[] post = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
  auth.ToCharArray());
String targetFrameName = "";
byte[] postData = null;
Uri uri = new Uri("http://www.contoso.com/");
webBrowser1.Navigate(uri, targetFrameName, postData, auth);</pre>

I was doing a crossword puzzle this afternoon and needed some Shakespeare quotes to complete the clues. (Sometimes, I can't get the answer from the clue alone. I need help.) So I googled for a specific Shakespeare play, act, and scene, and it came up with 
<a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/">Open Source Shakespeare</a>. 
It's amazing! It has all the plays, all the sonnets, and a concordance. What more could you ask for?</p>

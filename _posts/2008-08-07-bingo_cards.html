<p>Yes, finding custom bingo card generators on the internet is the kind of pseudo-technical challenge I occasionally get roped into. My sister-in-law is getting married, so my wife needed some sort of bingo cards for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelorette_party">bachelorette party</a>. I'm not asking what that's all about. Anyway, I didn't want to write software for this, so finding it on the internet was my best choice.</p>

<p>There are a lot of amazingly bad choices out there, but the most common failing is the creation of cards where the text is only one text line high per row. Sheesh!</p>

<p>This is clearly the best: <a href="http://print-bingo.com/bingo-cards-custom.php">print-bingo.com</a>. Here are the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>configurable free square (free or not; text in free square)</li>
<li>size of text</li>
<li>cards per page of paper</li>
<li>size of bingo card</li>
<li>configurable word list</li>
<li>words appear in designated column only or any column</li>
<li>column headers</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a great bachelorette party, Lisa!</p>

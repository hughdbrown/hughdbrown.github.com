<blockquote class="quote"><p>On the other hand, we recognize that you are busy and that the reason you visit a Web site like the Script Center is because you don't really have the time to learn WMI, let alone sit down and write a WMI script. And that's why we created Scriptomatic. As long as you can accept a few limitations, Scriptomatic will write your WMI scripts for you. It will even wash your car, wax your floors, and slice and dice vegetables!</p>

<p>Well, okay. But it does write your WMI scripts for you.</p></blockquote>

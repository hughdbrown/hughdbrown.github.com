<p>I tried out the Windows 7 Beta earlier this year. I had that sinking feeling in my gut when I realized that I would have to reinstall all my programs in order to move from Windows XP sp2 to WIndows 7 Beta. Apparently, the directory structures were not the same so the programs would not run. Or something. I sucked it up and installed a raft of development tools so that I could have the new OS. At least I was only going to have to do this once.</p>

<p>So when I ran the upgrade installation program for Windows 7 Professional, I was surprised to get this message:</p>

<blockquote>Windows 7 Ultimate cannot be upgraded to Windows 7 Professional. You can choose to install a new copy of Windows 7 Professional instead, but this is different from an upgrade, and does not keep your files, settings, and programs. <strong>You'll need to reinstall any programs using the original installation discs or files.</strong> To save your files before installing Windows, back them up to an external location such as a CD, DVD, or external hard drive. To install a new copy of Windows 7 Professional, click the Back button in the upper left-hand corner, and select "Custom (advanced)".[EMphasis added]</blockquote>

<p>So what do you think: should moving from Windows 7 Ultimate (beta) to Windows 7 Professional (release) require reinstallation of every non-operating system program on my machine? Would you go ahead or just return the upgrade package and wait until Microsoft gets its act together?</p>

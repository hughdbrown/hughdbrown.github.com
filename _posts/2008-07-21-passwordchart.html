<p><a href="http://www.passwordchart.com/">PasswordChart.com</a> is an interesting variation on generation of strong password keys. You supply a phrase and it generates an MD5-based table of hash segments. You provide a password and it generates a strong password from the table. I take this to mean that you can have strong passwords for multiple websites by 
<ul>
	<li>remembering a single phrase and </li>
	<li>supplying the names of websites you intend to use them on.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Preliminary tests I've done with strong password checkers (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/checker.mspx">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.securitystats.com/tools/password.php">SecurityStats</a>, <a href="http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php">Rumkins.com</a>) indicate that the resulting passwords are highly rated.</p>

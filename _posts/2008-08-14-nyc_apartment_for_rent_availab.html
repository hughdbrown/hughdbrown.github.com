<p>A friend of mine has a studio that is available for rent stating September first. Here is her description:</p>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>My former apartment on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=west+81st+at+Columbus,+New+York,+NY&sll=40.787512,-73.977363&sspn=0.011064,0.019312&layer=c&ie=UTF8&ll=40.787317,-73.975153&spn=0.011064,0.019312&z=16&cbll=40.783081,-73.974107&panoid=qrSKOq-5RmvXpV6v5wNXUQ">West 81st Street at Amsterdam</a> (prime Thanksgiving balloon-viewing real estate, as many of you know) is available for rent as of September 1.  It's a large (550 square feet) sunny studio with high ceilings, a fabulous location, and great park views.</p>
 
<p>Please let me know if you or anyone you know might be interested -- act fast, as it will be given to a broker to rent by the end of next week if no one contacts me before then.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also: doorman building, elevator, laundry facilities.</p>

<p>Please contact me through this blog to express interest.</p>

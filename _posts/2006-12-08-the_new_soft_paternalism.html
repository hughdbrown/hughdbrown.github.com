<blockquote class="quote">
<p>But what if it could be shown that even highly competent,
well-informed people fail to make choices in their best interest? And
what if the government could somehow step in and nudge them in the
right direction without interfering with their liberty, or at least not
very much? Welcome to the new world of "soft paternalism." The old
"hard" paternalism says, We know what's best for you, and we'll force
you to do it. By contrast, soft paternalism says, You know what's best
for you, and we'll help you to do it.</p>

<p>Here's an example. In some
states with casino gambling, like Missouri and Michigan, compulsive
gamblers have the option of putting their names on a blacklist, or
"self-exclusion" list, that bars them from casinos. Once on the list,
they are banned for life. If they violate the ban, they risk being
arrested and having their winnings confiscated. In Missouri, more than
10,000 people have availed themselves of this program. In Michigan, the
first person to sign up for it was, as it happens, also the first to be
arrested for violating its terms when he couldn't resist sneaking back
to the blackjack tables; he was sentenced to a year's probation, and
the state kept his winnings of $1,223.</p></blockquote>

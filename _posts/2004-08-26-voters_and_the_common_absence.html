<blockquote class="quote"><p>In the face of this evidence, three theories have arisen. The first is that electoral outcomes, as far as "the will of the people" is concerned, are
essentially arbitrary. The fraction of the electorate that responds to
substantive political arguments is hugely outweighed by the fraction that
responds to slogans, misinformation, "fire alarms" (sensational news), "October
surprises" (last-minute sensational news), random personal associations, and
"gotchas." Even when people think that they are thinking in political terms,
even when they believe that they are analyzing candidates on the basis of their
positions on issues, they are usually operating behind a veil of political
ignorance. They simply don't understand, as a practical matter, what it means
to be "fiscally conservative," or to have "faith in the private sector," or to
pursue an "interventionist foreign policy." They can't hook up positions with
policies. From the point of view of democratic theory, American political
history is just a random walk through a series of electoral options. Some
years, things turn up red; some years, they turn up blue.</p>

<p>A second theory is that although people may not be working with a full deck of
information and beliefs, their preferences are dictated by something, and that
something is &eacute;lite opinion. Political campaigns, on this theory, are
essentially struggles among the &eacute;lite, the fraction of a fraction of voters who
have the knowledge and the ideological chops to understand the substantive
differences between the candidates and to argue their policy implications.
These voters communicate their preferences to the rest of the electorate by
various cues, low-content phrases and images (warm colors, for instance) to
which voters can relate, and these cues determine the outcome of the race.
Democracies are really oligarchies with a populist face.</p>

<p>The third theory of democratic politics is the theory that the cues to which
most voters respond are, in fact, adequate bases on which to form political
preferences. People use shortcuts--the social-scientific term is "heuristics"--to
reach judgments about political candidates, and, on the whole, these shortcuts
are as good as the long and winding road of reading party platforms, listening
to candidate debates, and all the other elements of civic duty. Voters use what
Samuel Popkin, one of the proponents of this third theory, calls
"low-information rationality"--in other words, gut reasoning--to reach political
decisions; and this intuitive form of judgment proves a good enough substitute
for its high-information counterpart in reflecting what people want.</p></blockquote>

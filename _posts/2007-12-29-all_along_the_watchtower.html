<p>The Clapton, Kravitz, and Young covers are worth watching. The Brian Ferry one is pretty anemic. YouTube has many worse covers, including U2's, that I wouldn't even link to.</p>

<p>Update 2009-04-09: The Clapton and Kravitz links have been removed from YouTube for copyright violation. Sigh. They were great. Still, try the new Clapton and Kravitz version.</p>

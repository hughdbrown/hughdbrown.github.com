[<a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/">WatiN</a>]<br />Automate Internet Explorer for testing web applications and screen scraping content. I recently used this to log in to my notepad.yahoo.com account, find all the pages, and download the content to a file so that I could backfill my blog content. The object model is very simple and since it integrates with the .NET development environment, it has intellisense.<br />

<p>I've also been fairly active in Meetup.com groups, following the latest developments in the python, .NET, and the ALT.NET communities. [<a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/7521380/">Meetup profile</a>]</p>

<p>There is no substantive Unix on my resume, but recently I have been doing a lot with Ubuntu (Hardy and Jaunty) because I have been deploying my Django applications to Apache. I've installed Ubuntu with Apache and development tools to my laptop, a home server, a server at slicehost.net, and a server at webfaction.com.</p>

<p>I've also started to push out my projects as open source on <a href="http://github.com/hughdbrown">github.com</a>. So far, all of the work is in python and django. The django work has given me a chance to brush up on my web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

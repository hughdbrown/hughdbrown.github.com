<p><a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">NetFlix</a> is sponsoring a programming contest with a $1 million prize.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The Netflix Prize seeks to substantially improve the accuracy of predictions about how much someone is going to love a movie based on their movie preferences.  Improve it enough and you win one (or more) Prizes.  Winning the Netflix Prize improves our ability to connect people to the movies they love.</p></blockquote>

It combines an efficient storage scheme with an intuitive high-level API that allows contestants to focus on the real problem, the recommendation system algorithm.</p>

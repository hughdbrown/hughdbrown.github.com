<h1>S3Fox Organizer for FireFox</h1>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>S3Fox Organizer for Amazon(S3Fox) v0.4: (NEW!) This firefox extension(browser plugin) provides an user friendly interface for Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) . Its interface is very much similar to the FTP interface that lists local folders in the left panel and S3 buckets/files/folders in the right panel. Files/folders can be moved from the local computer to Amazon's storage space and vice versa.</p></blockquote>

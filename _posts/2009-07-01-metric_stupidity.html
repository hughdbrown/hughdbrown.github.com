<p>What are you supposed to do when you see something so flagrantly wrong as this (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/107235/10-pricey-cities-that-pay-off.html?mod=realestate-buy">Yahoo: Ten Pricey Cities that Pay Off</a>)?</p>

<blockquote class="quote">When you pay a lot of money for something, you hope to get a lot of value in return. Despite the housing downturn and the number of cheap houses it has left in its wake, there is still plenty of expensive land left. According to the Global Property Guide, an online real estate investor's guide, New York might have slipped from the second-most-expensive city in the world in 2008 to the sixth most expensive in 2009, but an average <strong>120-square-meter (373-square-foot)</strong> apartment in the central business district will still cost you a hefty $14,898 per square meter.</blockquote>

<p>A square meter is not about 3 square feet. It's more than 10 square feet. You take the number of feet per meter (3.28 feet / meter) and square that to get the square feet per square meter (10.76 square feet / square meter). Is that so hard? The cited apartment is more like 1300 square feet, assuming the journalist got this original fact right.</p>

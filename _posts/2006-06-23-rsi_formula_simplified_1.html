<p>I've seen the RSI formula many times but never seen this algebraic simplification that makes the measure intuitive.<p>

<pre class="prettyprint">Substitute y = U / D
 
RSI = 100 - [100 / [ 1 + y] ]
RSI = 100 * [1 - 1 / [ 1 + y] ] (factor out 100)
RSI = 100 * [1 + y - 1] / [ 1 + y] (common denom of <em>1 + y</em>)
RSI = 100 * y / [ 1 + y] (reduce)
RSI = 100 * [U / D] / [ 1 + U / D] (substitute y)
RSI = 100 * [U / D] / [ [D + U] / D] (common denom)
RSI = 100 * U / [D + U] (elim div by <em>D</em>)</pre>

<p>Clearly this is not so. RSI is the ratio of up-moves to the sum of all moves scaled onto the range 0 to 100. That's really simple to explain.</p>

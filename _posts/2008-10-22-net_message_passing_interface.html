<blockquote class="quote"><p>MPI.NET is a high-performance, easy-to-use implementation of the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">Message Passing Interface</a> (MPI) for Microsoft's .NET environment. MPI is the de facto standard for writing parallel programs running on a distributed memory system, such as a compute cluster, and is widely implemented. Most MPI implementations provide support for writing MPI programs in C, C++, and Fortran. MPI.NET provides support for all of the .NET languages (especially C#), and includes significant extensions (such as automatic serialization of objects) that make it far easier to build parallel programs that run on clusters.</p></blockquote>

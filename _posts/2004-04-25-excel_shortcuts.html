<h1>Remote assistance</h1>
<blockquote class="quote"><p>XP's Remote Desktop tool lets you remotely administer other Windows XP machines, as well as Windows 2000 and 2003 servers. On the client machine, select Start | All Programs | Accessories | Communications | Remote Desktop Connection, and enter the IP address of the computer you intend to connect to. If the connection is permitted, you'll get a window onto the server machine and be able to control it just as if you were sitting in front of its keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Conversely, you can set your Windows XP machine to accept connections from remote systems. Right-click on My Computer, select Properties, select the Remote tab, and mark the check box under Remote Desktop, then click on Select Remote Users... to specify who can access your machine.</p>

<p>Windows XP's Remote Assistance lets you request help from a friend or help desk staff, who can then log on during a period of time you specify, taking control while you observe (and chat via Windows Messenger). For these remote tools to work, your firewall or router will need to permit traffic across port 3389.</p></blockquote>

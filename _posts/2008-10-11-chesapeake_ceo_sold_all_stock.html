<blockquote class="quote"><p> Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Chesapeake Energy Corp. said its chief executive officer, Aubrey McClendon, involuntarily sold ``substantially all'' of his common shares of the company's stock over the past three days to meet margin loan calls.</p>

<p>"These involuntary and unexpected sales were precipitated by the extraordinary circumstances of the worldwide financial crisis,'' McClendon said in today's statement. "In no way do these sales reflect my view of the company's financial position or my view of Chesapeake's future performance potential.''</p>

<p>McClendon, 49, owned 33.5 million shares, or 5.8 percent of the company's common stock, according to a Sept. 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He was the company's third-largest shareholder.</p></blockquote>

<p>One word: wow.</p>

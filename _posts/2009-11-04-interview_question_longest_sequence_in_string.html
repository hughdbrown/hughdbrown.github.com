<p>I had an interesting question in a phone interview today: find the longest consecutive sequence of a letter in a string. So if your data is <em>AABBBA</em>, the longest sequence is the three B's. I came up with a brute force algorithm that runs in O(n) time: split the string into an array of strings, each string filled with identical characters. Then iterate over the array and return the character and length of the longest.</p>

<p>But of course this requires extra memory and the problem does not, so the interviewer encouraged me to find another solution. I thought this sounded a lot like the maximum subsequence problem, so I sketched out <a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/the-maximum-subsequence-problem">this algorithm</a> that I covered in a <a href="http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/2008/04/maximum-subsequence.html">blog article in 2008</a>.</p>

<p>But when I was done the interview, I was not satisfied. Of course I can't do better than O(n), but what if I found the algorithm with the lowest multiplier? I zeroed in on a divide-and-conquer algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the midpoint of the string</li>
<li>Search left and right for the start and end of the consecutive sequence</li>
<li>If the left unsearched string is at least as long as the longest string found, search it</li>
<li>If the right unsearched string is at least as long as the longest string found, search it</li>
<li>Return the length and character of the longest run in the left, middle, and right strings</li>
</ol>

<p>And that would look like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
def longest_substring(s, min_length):
    def find_left(s, midc, mid):
        for j in range(mid-1, -1, -1):
            if s[j] != midc:
                return j + 1
        return j
    def find_right(s, midc, mid):
        for k in range(mid+1, len(s)):
            if s[k] != midc:
                return k
        return len(s)
    mid = len(s) // 2
    midc = s[mid]
    j = find_left(s, midc, mid)
    k = find_right(s, midc, mid)
    left, middle, right = s[:j], s[j:k], s[k:]
    #print left, middle, right
    b = (len(middle), midc)
    min_length = max(min_length, b[0])
    a = longest_substring(left, min_length) if len(left) > min_length else None
    c = longest_substring(right, min_length) if len(right) > min_length else None
    return max([a, b, c])

def search_longest_substring(s):
    return longest_substring(s, 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print search_longest_substring("AABCBBBBACCDDDDDDA")
</pre>

<p>Obviously, this could be improved upon so as not to take an extra copy of the string by copying left, middle, and right: the code could pass in the left and right indexes into the string and operate based on the indexes. And then it would look like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
def longest_substring(s, left, right, min_length):
    def find_left(s, midc, mid, left):
        for j in range(mid-1, left-1, -1):
            if s[j] != midc:
                return j + 1
        return left-1
    def find_right(s, midc, mid, right):
        for k in range(mid+1, right):
            if s[k] != midc:
                return k
        return right
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    midc = s[mid]
    j = find_left(s, midc, mid, left)
    k = find_right(s, midc, mid, right)
    #print s[left:j], s[j:k], s[k:right]
    b = (k-j, midc)
    min_length = max(min_length, b[0])
    a = longest_substring(s, left, j, min_length) if (j-left) > min_length else None
    c = longest_substring(s, k, right, min_length) if (right-k) > min_length else None
    return max([a, b, c])

def search_longest_substring(s):
    return longest_substring(s, 0, len(s), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print search_longest_substring("AABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDAAABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDDAAABBBBCBBBBACCDDDDDDA")
</pre>

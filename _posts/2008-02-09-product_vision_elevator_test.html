<p>A product vision model helps team members pass the elevator test -- the ability to explain the project to someone within two minutes. It comes from Geoffrey Moore's book <i>Crossing the Chasm</i>. It follows the form:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">for (target customer)<br />
who (statement of need or opportunity)<br />
the (product name)<br />
is a (product category)<br />
that (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)<br />
unlike (primary competitive alternative)<br />
our product (statement of primary differentiation)<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a product vision statement helps teams remain focused on the critical aspects of the product, even when details are changing rapidly. It is very easy to get focused on the short-term issues associated with a 2-4 week development iteration and lose track of the overall product vision.</p>

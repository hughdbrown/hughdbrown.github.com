<p><a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">numpy</a> provides the underlying data structures (array and matrices among other things) you require. This will handle all your vector stuff, reading/writing to and from files, "loop macros", etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> provides a set of scientific programming libraries, including stats, fft and many other things. Have a look around and see if it already does what you want.</p>

<p><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> takes care of all your plotting needs, and plays nice with numpy and scipy.</p>

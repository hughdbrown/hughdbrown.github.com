<li>IPC (tcp/ip, udp, shared mem)</li>
</ul>

<p>I ask questions based on what the candidate can tell me in detail about the work they have done. I always get them to tell me "how" they did a project, and to avoid lingering on "what" it did. Once the architecture is revealed, I ask questions about it - like "Why did you do it that way when it would have been better to do it some other way (giving an alternative)?". I always ask the candidate to sell themselves on 2 or 3 pieces of work which most closely represent how able they are as a programmer. Then I ask them to justify it. It's normally pretty clear in a short space of time whether they are a serious programmer or just a hobbyist working on the peripherals of someone elses work. The main problem is getting to stop telling me what the application does and focus on how they solved the problem.</p>

<p>I've been asked a few times about appdomains. I know the basics in a theoretical way, but I was unclear on the actual application. I asked my first question at StackOverflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97433/good-example-of-use-of-appdomain">Good example of use of AppDomain</a>, to clarify.</p>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>2008-09-20: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/04/03/61190.aspx">What is an application domain - an explanation for .Net beginners</a> appears to be the basis for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appdomain">wikipedia article on appdomains</a>.</p>

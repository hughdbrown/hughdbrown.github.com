<p>Spoke with <a href="http://iwebthereforeiam.com/jobs/2008/05/#001584">David Gold</a>.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is putting positions on hold. They are not hiring but things could change in June. He believes they may be having layoffs. Many companies are interviewing and not hiring. His Morgan Stanley contact told him, "Don't work on these jobs -- nothing is happening until June." He describes it as "not a very good market, brutal."</p>
<p>I asked about contract positions. They do do them, but he has nothing now.</p>
<p>He reminds me that the feedback from Morgan Stanley in Purchase, NY, was positive so I should hang tight with it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobresults.aspx?strCrit=rawWords=(accountdid:a7c2t95wl8ktr2yht3s+accountdid:a7c0h66yzwblnf89s6x)">shortage of positions on the CODGI.com website</a> indicates this may be accurate.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.codefetch.com/">CodeFetch</a>] allows developers to search programming books online for code samples in the language of their choice.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to find a C# code sample that implements a priority queue, like <a href="../../2008/05/programming-challange-find-top.html">I did here</a>. You could get several implementations from <a href="http://www.codefetch.com/search?qy=priorityqueue&lang=csharp">CodeFetch</a> with a simple search. Mind you, the implementations I'm seeing are a bit bizarre. Would you really implement a priority queue by maintaining a sorted array?</p>

<h1>A Train lyrics</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>You must take the "A" train<br />
To go Sugar Hill 'way up in Harlem<br />
If you miss the "A" train<br />
You'll find you've missed the quickest way to Harlem</p>

<p>Hurry, get on now it's coming<br />
Listen to those rails a-humming<br />
All 'board get on the "A" train<br />
Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem</p></blockquote>

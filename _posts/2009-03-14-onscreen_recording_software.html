<p>I recently came across <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/download/pc/">Jing</a> being used at <a href="http://www.screencast.com">ScreenCast</a> for recording onscreen demos. It's free so I'm going to give it a try.</p>

<p>I've also had recommendations for <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia</a>. I may try the demo for that, too.</p>

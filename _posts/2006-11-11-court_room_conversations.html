<h1><a href="http://moronland.net/moronia/moron/919/">Court Room Conversations</a></h1>

<p>Hilarious courtroom exchanges. Sample:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor?<br />
WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.<br />
ATTORNEY: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?<br />
WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law.<br /></blockquote>

The annual Pop Concert was a beloved institution at Dondero High School from 1971-2006. It was directed by music instructor Rick Hartsoe for 35 years, assisted by Jan Stewart since 1983. The A Capella Choir and student instrumentalists traditionally presented 20 popular songs per concert: ten full choir pieces chosen for their harmonic and instrumental interest, and ten solos of the students' choosing. The nine soloists were student-selected via an audition process, and the top soloist each year was obliged to perform an encore.<br /><br />[<a href="http://www.comfortstand.com/artists/dondero.html">Dondero High School music</a>]

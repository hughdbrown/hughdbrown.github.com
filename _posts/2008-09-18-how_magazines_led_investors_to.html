<p>Bad news for investors who take <a href="http://gawker.com/5050946/how-magazines-led-investors-toward-ruin">stock tips from Fortune</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">In December, Fortune magazine admitted it had been remiss naming insurance giant AIG one of its "10 Stocks To Buy Now" before a yearlong 18 percent decline. "We... didn't expect [the] mortgage unit to be such an albatross," editors wrote. To correct the error, the magazine had a fresh list of "The Best Stocks For 2008" -- including Merrill Lynch. "Smart investors should buy this stock before everyone else comes to their senses," Fortune wrote, calling a recent correction in Merrill stock "an overreaction." Investors who followed this advice are now down 93 percent. </blockquote>

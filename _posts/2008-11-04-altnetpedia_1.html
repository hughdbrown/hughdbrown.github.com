<ul>
	<li>The type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way.</li>
	<li>You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby, etc.</li>
	<li>You're not content with the status quo. Things can always be better expressed, more elegant and simple, more mutable, higher quality, etc.</li>
	<li>You know tools are great, but they only take you so far. It's the principles and knowledge that really matter. The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principles (e.g. Resharper.)</li>

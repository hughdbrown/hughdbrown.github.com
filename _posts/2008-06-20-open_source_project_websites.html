<p>Not entirely on the mark. Some of these sites maintain real open source projects. Others, like CodeProject, are write-only sites with no collaboration.</p>

<ul>
<li>[<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>]<br />

CodePlex is Microsoft's open source project hosting web site.</li>

<li>[<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>]<br />

SourceForge.net is the world's largest Open Source software development web site. SourceForge.net provides free hosting to Open Source software development projects with a centralized resource for managing projects, issues, communications, and code.</li>

<li>[<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>]<br />

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.</li>

<li>[<a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">FreshMeat</a>]<br />

freshmeat maintains the Web's largest index of Unix and cross-platform software, themes and related "eye-candy", and Palm OS software. Thousands of applications, which are preferably released under an open source license, are meticulously cataloged in the freshmeat database, and links to new applications are added daily. Each entry provides a description of the software, links to download it and to obtain more information, and a history of the project's releases, so readers can keep up-to-date on the latest developments.</li>

<li>[<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a>]<br />

The Code Project was formed to provide developers with a place to meet and exchange ideas. We hope to provide developers with all the resources they need to help them in their day to day programming, as well as helping them keep up to date with the latest technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just saw the concert film, <em>Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man</em>. It's a great tribute to the songs of Leonard Cohen, Canadian poet and songwriter from Montreal. There are a half dozen songs that are well worth the film:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I'm Your Man</em> (Cohen's version, sung over the ending credits)</li>
	<li><em>Everybody Knows</em>
<blockquote class="quote"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Knows_(Leonard_Cohen_song)">wikipedia</a>:Five minutes, thirty-seven seconds in duration, <em>Everybody Knows</em> is known for its somber tone and repetition of the title at the beginning of most verses. Featuring phrases such as "Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a long-stemmed rose...", <em>Everybody Knows</em> has been variously described by critics as "bitterly pessimistic" yet funny, or, more strongly, a "bleak prophecy about the end of the world as we know it."</p></blockquote>
</li>
	<li><em>The Traitor</em></li>
	<li><em>Suzanne</em></li>
	<li><em>Hallelujah</em>
<blockquote class="quote"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)">wikipedia</a>: <em>Hallelujah</em> is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen originally released on his 1984 studio album Various Positions. A live recording of the song from 1988, containing additional lyrics, appears on the 1994 album, Cohen Live. While <em>Suzanne</em> is his most covered work to date, <em>Hallelujah</em> has experienced great popularity more recently and has now been recorded more than 170 times for release and has been featured in the soundtracks of numerous movies and television shows.</p><blockquote></li>
	<li><em>Tower of Song</em> (Leonard Cohen backed by U2)</li>

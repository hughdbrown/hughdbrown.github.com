<li>The final sentence<br />
<p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... And one fine morning -</p>

<p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p></li>

<li>Tom and Daisy<br />
<p>They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.</p></li>
</ol>

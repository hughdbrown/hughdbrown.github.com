<blockquote class="quote"><p>On Saturday November 8th, 2008, the Fairfield / Westchester developer community will be holding our second Fairfield / Westchester Code Camp! The event will be hosted by The University of Connecticut School of Business, at the Stamford Campus.</p>

<p>The continuing goal of the Code Camps series is to provide an intensive developer-to-developer learning experience that is fun and technically stimulating. The primary focus is on delivering programming information and sample code that can be put to practical use. The event is free.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'll be there!</p>

<h1><a href="http://books.google.com">Google books</a></h1>

<p>Google Books is really cool. There are lots of books you can browse online. In fact, many appear to be available nearly in their entirety. I noticed it again today (2008-11-04, an update) when <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DW2ldput788C">Programming WCF Services</a> appeared in my google search and I was amazed to find how much of the content was available to examine.</p>

<p>A great article on the legendary blues song, <a href="http://robwalker.net/html_docs/letterthirteen.html">St. James Infirmary</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">I went down to St. James Infirmary,<br />
Saw my baby there.<br />
She was stretched out on a long white table,<br />
So sweet, so cold, so bare.<br />
<br />
Let her go, let her go, God bless her.<br />
Wherever she may be,<br />
She can search this whole wide world over,<br />
She ain't never gonna find another man like me.<br /></blockquote>

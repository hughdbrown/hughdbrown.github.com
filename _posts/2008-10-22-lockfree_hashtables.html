<h1><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2139967204534450862">Google video on lock-free hashtables</a></h1>
<p>Talk on implementation of a lock-free hashtable in Java on a multiprocessor box -- like 100 to 700 cpus.</p>
<!--
closed power-of-2 hash table (can get index from hash using AND operation)
reprobe on collision
put operation does not allocate
key slot is [ null or key ]
value is [ null, tombstone for deleted value, or value ]
once a key is set, it never changes; table fills up with dead keys
-->

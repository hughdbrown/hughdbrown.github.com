<p>New Yorker article on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge. Fascinating in a macabre way.</p>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>Update 2008-10-12: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/11suicide.html?_r=1&ref=us&oref=slogin">Golden Gate Managers Vote to Build Suicide Net</a></p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>SAN FRANCISCO -- After decades of debate, and unknown numbers of lost lives, the board that controls the Golden Gate Bridge took a major step toward building a suicide barrier on Friday, voting to erect a net under the span.</p>

<p>The 14-to-1 vote came after several failed efforts over the years to support a physical barrier on the Golden Gate, where troubled souls have long leapt to their deaths.</p>

<p>The current plan still must pass a final environmental review, including a look at how a net might affect pelicans and cormorants, which frequent the bridge. It also needs financing: the estimated cost of the metal net is $40 million to $50 million.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's nice of them to do this after so long but still a bit troubling that it might be blocked by its estimated effect on pelicans.</p></blockquote>

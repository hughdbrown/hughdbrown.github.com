<p>A one-link YouTube post. Student talks through his calculus problems, set to Gloria Gaynor's <i>I Will Survive</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p><pre>So I thought back to calculus,
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz
And to problems just like this.
And just like that when I had given up all hope,
I said, "Nope! There's just one way to find that slope!"</pre</p>

<p><pre>And so now I -- I will derive.
Find the derivative of x position with respect to time.
It's as easy as can be
Just have to take dx/dt.
I will derive --I will derive.</p></pre></blockquote>

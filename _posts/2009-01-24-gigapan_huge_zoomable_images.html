<p><a href="http://www.gigapan.org/">GigaPan</a> has huge high resolution panoramas on its website that are zoomable down to very low detail. In this image of the <a href="http://gigapan.org/viewGigapanFullscreen.php?auth=033ef14483ee899496648c2b4b06233c">Obama inauguration</a>, you can see faces pretty clearly up to 1000 meters from the camera.</p>

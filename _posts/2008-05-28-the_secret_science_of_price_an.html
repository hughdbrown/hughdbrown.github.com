<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047013898X/tag=iwebtherefore-20"><em>The Secret Science of Price and Volume: Techniques for Spotting Market Trends, Hot Sectors, and the Best Stocks</em></a> is yet another book on trading that I came across at Amazon. I'm familiar with looking at price and volume and I've seen top-down methods of stock selection, but I haven't seen a really integrated method. In particular, I haven't seen something that gives a good idea of where the market is heading, and that's one of the things this method relies on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gauge the sentiment of a market to determine if the trend is bullish or bearish, and whether a possible high or low is nearby</li>
	<li>Evaluate breadth, volume, and momentum in order to identify triggers to enter the market</li>
	<li>Find the best performing sectors that are aligned with the market</li>
	<li>Select the strongest stocks within those sectors</li>
</ul>

A <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kolesnikova13-2008may13,0,4111689.story">great article</a> on teenagers' use of language picked up from the web and text messaging.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Language that makes you say OMG<br />
Teens are letting emoticons and other forms of chat-speak slip into their essays and homework.</b><br />
<br />
Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between a person LOLing and
crying -- but I am definitely weeping. The cause for my
earth-shattering depression is an April 25 Pew Research Center study
that polled 12- to 17-year-olds on their attitudes about writing. A
heart-stopping 38% said they let chat-speak -- such as LOL (for
"laughing out loud"), ROFL ("rolling on the floor laughing"), BRB ("be
right back"), TTYL ("talk to ya later") -- slip into essays and
homework.<br />
<br />
I propose a new chat term: KMN. "Kill me now." <br />

<h1><a href="http://www.slackermanager.com/slacker_manager/2005/09/fast_track_your.html">How to fast track your career</a></h1>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Many big organizations have "fast track" programs. When someone is selected to be a fast tracker, it usually means that the person is recognized as being a "high potential" person within the organization. With fast track/HiPo designation comes a variety of positions, often spanning the scope of the business, within a relatively short period of time. Relatively short means a few years rather than a few decades. Being a fast tracker isn't a cake walk. Candidates are often given serious challenges within the organization, to see how they can perform. The payoff, of course, is increased responsibility and increased compensation.</p>

<p>However, most organizations don't have formalized fast track programs. Sure, you may stumble upon a gracious mentor who can give you a leg up now and then but, on the whole, you're on your own. No fear, though. There are plenty of opportunities to fast track yourself. No need to talk about it-in fact, it's better that you don't talk about your plans until you've racked up at least a couple of successes. Until then, talk like that just makes other people nervous and more likely to try and subvert your plans. So mum's the word for now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Flixxy has a great trailer for an animated film, <a href="http://www.flixxy.com/coraline-movie-preview.htm">Coraline</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) is bored in her new home until she finds a secret door and discovers an alternate version of her life on the other side. On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life and the people in it - only much better. But when this seemingly perfect world turns dangerous, and her other parents try to trap her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination and bravery to escape this increasingly perilous world - and save her family.</p></blockquote>

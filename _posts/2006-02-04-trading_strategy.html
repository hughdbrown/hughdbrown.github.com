<blockquote class="quote"><p>This strategy has 4 rules, yet it has been correct in the 80% range over the past decade. Here are the rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The S&amp;P 500 is trading above its 200-day simple moving average.</li>
	<li>Today, it trades (intra-day) at a 10-day low.</li>
	<li>Today the VIX closes 5% or more above its 10-day simple moving average.</li>
	<li>Buy the S&amp;P 500 on the close and exit when it closes above its 10-period simple moving average.</li>

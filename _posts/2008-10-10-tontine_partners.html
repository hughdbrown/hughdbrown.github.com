<blockquote class="quote"><p>Copper River, a well-known fund that focuses on short selling, lost more than 50% in September, while Tontine Partners, run by Jeffrey Gendell, fell by almost 60%, according to investors.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>an annuity scheme in which subscribers share a common fund with the benefit of survivorship, the survivors' shares being increased as the subscribers die, until the whole goes to the last survivor.</p></blockquote>

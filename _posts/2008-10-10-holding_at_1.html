<p>One of the technical indicators I track is the <a href="http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$NYA50R&p=D&yr=3&mn=0&dy=0&id=p67065509431">percentage of NYSE stocks trading above their 50-day moving average</a>. Usually, when this indicator hits 10-15%, it's the bottom of the bear rally, and usually the top is at 75-80%. Currently, this indicator has been <a href="http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$NYA50R&p=D&st=2007-10-10&en=2008-10-10&id=p07081575242">holding steady at 1%</a> for the past two days, the lowest number I've ever seen. And yet, I don't see a reason to believe we've seen the bottom yet.</p>

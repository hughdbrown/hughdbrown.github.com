      [<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2041234,00.asp">Make bootable USB drive</a>]<br /><br />

<p>What do you do when your computer won't boot, your most recent backup is three months old, and you don't have an emergency CD? What if you're using a laptop that doesn't even have a CD drive? Kiss your data goodbye-or just whip out the bootable USB key (or thumb drive) you prepared in advance. The key will boot into a free Windows-based system called BartPE (that's Bart's Preinstalled Environment), devised by Bart Lagerweij, from which you can copy files on your hard drive to the key or, in some cases, send them over a network to another machine.</p>

<p>Now, not all computers can boot from all USB keys; you'll need to experiment with yours-unfortunately, there's no way to predict if it'll work.</p>

<p>The tools you'll need are a USB 2.0-compatible drive with 256MB or more of storage space; a Microsoft Windows XP installation CD with Service Pack 2 (see step 1, below, if you don't have a Win XP CD with SP2); and Bart's PE -Builder, from www.nu2.nu/pebuilder. For faster booting on some but not all systems, you can try FlashBoot (20 euros, or about $25; www.primeexpert.com), which automates the process of installing the BartPE environment to a USB key.</p>

<p>Before booting from your USB key, locate your PC's BIOS settings and explore the menus to find the USB settings, or possibly the boot order settings, to add the key to the list of boot drives (write down any settings you change, in case you have to restore them later). You may need to specify that a USB key will be read as a hard drive, not a "super-floppy." One important note: There's a serious security risk involved in allowing your PC to boot from a USB key-anyone with a bootable key can take advantage of the capability.</p>

<ol>
<li>Got SP2?<br />
If your Windows XP CD includes Service Pack 2, skip this step. But if not, use AutoStreamer (www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=223562) to build a burnable CD image from your original Win XP CD with a "slipstreamed" SP2 file (download it from www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2; click Download and deploy SP2 to multiple computers). The Restore CD that comes with mass-market machines won't work; only an original Win XP install CD will.</li>

<li>Start Building<br />
PE Builder builds a BartPE disk by combining files from a Win XP-with-SP2 CD with its own files. For faster building, copy your CD to a folder on your hard drive, as we've done here. Choose Create ISO image to use your USB key-of course, Burn to CD/DVD would create a bootable CD.</li>

<li>Select Plug-ins<br />
PE Builder's plug-in dialog lists files included with the PE Builder download and others that require you to add commercial and freeware programs. You can also add network and other drivers following instructions on the PE Builder site; you may need to add drivers for network connectivity.</li>

<li>Flashboot It<br />
The easiest way to get BartPE on a USB key is with FlashBoot. Simply point the program at the ISO file created by PE Builder, select Convert BartPE Bootable Disk to Bootable Flash Disk, and let FlashBoot do the work. If the resulting USB key doesn't work, a slower-booting method may work instead. For details, see www.911cd.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=10806.</li>

<li>Start It Up<br />
It looks like the first screen you see when Windows XP starts up, but it's BartPE booting from a USB key.</li>

<li>That Should Be It. . .<br />
If all goes well, and you choose to start the network, BartPE will use DHCP to configure your network client automatically. If that doesn't work, move on to step 7.</li>
 
<li>. . . But if Not<br />
You may need to configure your network hardware manually. It's not difficult if you've ever dealt with network settings. You'll probably need to know the name of your network and the IP numbers of your router and any other networked machine that you want to access. But you don't really need a network, because you can save files directly to the USB key for retrieval from another machine.</li>

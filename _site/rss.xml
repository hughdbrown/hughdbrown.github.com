                <title>Actual powers of Congress</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the things that &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei&quot;&gt;Congress is actually empowered to do&lt;/a&gt;. Congressional actions outside this list are actually unconstitutional:&lt;/p&gt;:

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To establish post offices and post roads;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To provide and maintain a navy;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings;--And&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Microsoft 7 RC testers must pave machines</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm as much of a Microsoft fanboy as the next, but this recent email to Windows 7 RC users put me off a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It's time to upgrade from the Windows 7 Release Candidate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most people who tested Windows 7 have now moved to the final version, some are still running the Release Candidate. If you haven't moved yet, it's time to replace the RC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting on March 1, 2010 your PC will begin shutting down every two hours. Your work will not be saved during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows 7 RC will fully expire on June 1, 2010. Your PC running the Windows 7 RC will continue shutting down every two hours and your files won't be saved during shutdown. In addition, your wallpaper will change to a solid black background with a persistent message on your desktop. You'll also get periodic notifications that Windows isn't genuine. That means your PC may no longer be able to obtain optional updates or downloads requiring genuine Windows validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid interruption, please reinstall a prior version of Windows or move to Windows 7. In either case, &lt;b&gt;you'll need to do a custom (clean) install to replace the RC. As with any clean installation, you'll need to back up your data then reinstall your applications and restore the data.&lt;/b&gt; For more details about replacing the RC, see the Knowledge Base article KB 971767. For more information, visit the Window 7 Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for helping us test Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I installed Windows 7 RC, I had to re-install all my programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all my development tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my favorite text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screen capture application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WInSCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git+Mercurial+SVN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;python (Django, Twisted, PIL, numpy, setup-tools+pip+virtualenv, fabric, nltk, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WinZip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adobe *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paint.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WinDirStat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a zillion other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reluctant to do it. If I had known that installing this RC would require me to reinstall the universe twice, I'd never have put it on my machine. Thanks, Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>OpenCandy</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I upgraded my copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winscp.com/&quot;&gt;WinSCP&lt;/a&gt; &quot;(WinSCP is an open source free SFTP client and FTP client for Windows. Legacy SCP protocol is also supported. Its main function is safe copying of files between a local and a remote computer.&quot;) last night and during the installation, I was offered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xobni.com&quot;&gt;Xobni&lt;/a&gt; to install, too. It looked cool, so I installed it. I upgraded at home and was offered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wefi.com&quot;&gt;WeFi&lt;/a&gt;. I liked that so I installed it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, I was intrigued. I checked up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencandy.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCandy&lt;/a&gt;, the company that does the offers, and found that there is a network of companies that allow additional products to be pushed out during the installation of their products. It looks to me as if all of the products are pretty cool, but here are my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memeoconnect.com/&quot;&gt;MemeoConnect&lt;/a&gt;

                <title>Russian tunnel of death</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Michael Chepovetsky forwarded me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chepovetsky.com/pr/mov/RussianTunnelofDeath.wmv&quot;&gt;this video link&lt;/a&gt; from inside an underground roadway in Russia with this explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3150 meter Lefortovo Tunnel  in Russia is the longest in-city tunnel in the world. It is nicknamed &lt;i&gt;The Tunnel of Death&lt;/i&gt;. See for yourself why. There is a river running over the tunnel and water leaks through in some areas. When the temperature reaches nearly 0°C (as it does during winter in Russia), and the road freezes. The result is the attached video which were taken during a single day with the tunnel's surveillance camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the dual-carriage bus driver - imagine the passengers in
the back! What a ride! The next time you complain about traffic, remember
this video... Russian Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefortovo_tunnel&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the video is a compilation and not necessarily over a single day. Still.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Comment CAPTCHA compromised on Movable Type and WordPress?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of google-able spam comments I have started to get on my blog in the past two weeks suggests that the CAPTCHA from Movable Type that I use is compromised; it looks as if there is an automatic way to identify CAPTCHA images. And googling for these comments shows that many WordPress blogs are falling for this, too. I'd be interested to see comments (but not spam comments!) on this point.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Github subtree merge</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a GIT problem on GitHub. I had projects in a directory hierarchy like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;    root/src/lang1/project1
    root/src/lang1/project2
    root/src/lang1/project3
    ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that were in Git locally. Each was a separate Git repository. I then tried to (1) move the source to GitHub and (2) add other projects that were at the same level or higher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;    root/src/lang2/project-x
    root/src/lang3/project-y
    root/release/...
    root/docs/...
    ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Git took my intentions the wrong way. Instead of a single hierarchical repository from root/ down, I then had all of the stuff in root/ down except the lang1/ directories were all islands which GitHub thought of as submodules. Except not quite. These projects did not display with subfolders -- they displayed with the submodule icon, but I couldn't get the source from GitHub via them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix was quite easy once I'd contacted tech support at github and exchanged email with Tekkub. He recommended this &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.github.com/subtree-merge/&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; for a description of how to merge a subtree. I ended up with a script like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;# Put repository at
#    ../temp/DazUtility/DazUtilitySetup
# into subtree at
#     vb.net/DazUtility/DazUtilitySetup
git remote add -f A ../temp/DazUtility/DazUtilitySetup
git merge -s ours --no-commit A/master
git read-tree --prefix=vb.net/DazUtility/DazUtilitySetup A/master
git commit -m &quot;Merge with DazUtilitySetup&quot;
git push
git remote rm A&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt; strategy for the merge did not work with all my projects and I ended up using &lt;em&gt;resolve&lt;/em&gt; in one case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;git merge -s resolve --no-commit A/master&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final word: tech support at Github is awesome: fast and knowledgeable with great follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, if you get this blog remark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Dude.. I am not much into reading, but somehow I got to read lots of articles on your blog. Its amazing how interesting it is for me to visit you very often.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=%22I+am+not+much+into+reading%22&quot;&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-12-03: Similarly, if you get &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Good post mate!! Keep 'em flowing!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=&quot;Good+post+mate!!+Keep+'em+flowing!&quot;&quot;&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;. I guess comment spammers are going for generic remarks that look like they are paying attention to the blog's content as an alternative to, say, having a genuine interest in the blog's content.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My so-called life</title>
                <description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contract programming
&lt;p&gt;Translating VBA to VB.NET for use in a web-distributed Excel product; Access 2007 programming for managing the workflow of telemarketers in a company that re-sold telecomm services until they closed the telemarketing business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The first is actually cool, if you do any Windows work. For a start, the state of Excel and .NET integration is locked in 2005. You can't write VB.NET/C# UDFs that are called directly from an Excel cell. You have to expose the functions in a COM server, and the runtime burdens that imposes are annoying. For a start, calling Excel from the COM server is an order of magnitude slower than VBA within Excel, so I ended up re-implementing a lot of Excel functions in VB.NET: statistical functions, portfolio analytics, financial functions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Meetups and conferences
&lt;p&gt;Meetup.com provides a lot of opportunities to network. I go to NYC-Python, django-nyc, NYC .NET, and Alt.NET regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Interviews, job searches
&lt;p&gt;I had a good interview this week and the company is making very encouraging noises. They've given me a programming assignment to complete this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pro bono work
&lt;p&gt;Django programming for a micro-finance company that uses the Django admin to manage their volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Travel
&lt;p&gt;I was at DjangoCon in Portland in September followed by ten days in Spain. I have some family time coming up over Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent discovery: Tripit.com is great for keeping track of your travel. In particular, it is great for having a single point to track all your airmiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Show-and-tell dates
&lt;p&gt;I've recently concluded that having projects to show is way more important than a resume. No one gets my resume. Taking my laptop to meet friends and Meetup.com-types for coffee is a fairly productive networking technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Stupefying Django error</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. I spent a lot of time on this this afternoon. I had a Django application with an admin interface. Every time I tried to create an object with no foreign keys, I got this error on the save:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally mysterious: there is not a line of my code in the trace stack and I have no idea what file it is trying to index into. I really made no progress on this until I tried the shell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting somewhere, I thought. I have a function of mine in scope. The problem was that I had defined my __unicode__ method without using &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; in the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
class Sport(models.Model):    
    sport_name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    def __unicode__(self):
        return u&quot;%s&quot; % (&lt;strong&gt;self.&lt;/strong&gt;sport_name, )

    @models.permalink
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return ('sport', None, {'object_id' : self.id})

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['sport_name']
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fixing it was pretty easy once I knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>DataVision sucks</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So the Windows 7 upgrade that I reported yesterday gets better. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datavis.com/&quot;&gt;DataVision&lt;/a&gt;, the store in New York I bought the upgrade from, is totally unwilling to provide a refund or to take an exchange on the product &lt;strong&gt;because I opened the package.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't know of any way to determine that an operating system will not install on your machine without actually, you know, running the installation. Their recommendation? Take it up with Microsoft. Microsoft, understandably, says, &quot;Waaaah? We didn't sell you this. Talk to DataVision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stance of the manager, Joey (212 689 1111 x1746), is three-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You always have to reinstall your programs when you upgrade the operating system&lt;br /&gt;Patently untrue. Not true with any previous Microsoft OS I've used and not true for any Linux OS I've tried. Some people will say anything not to have to refund money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't refund money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't take back opened software&lt;br /&gt;
I have no idea how I would have known the installation would fail (or require reinstalling all programs) without opening the package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a suggestion of my own: don't do business with DataVision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-10-23: Maybe I should have known better. If you look for &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=8991819621108373082&amp;q=computer%2Bstore%2Blocations%2Bnew%2Byork&amp;hl=en&amp;view=feature&amp;mcsrc=detailed_reviews&amp;num=10&amp;start=0&quot;&gt;ratings of DataVision on the web&lt;/a&gt;, it's pretty consistently rated one of the worst places to get computer service in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They truly have the worst customer service in the world&quot; ... &quot;Located in midtown Manhattan, this computer store leaves much to be desired&quot; ... &quot;ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!&quot; ... &quot;The prices are pretty good&quot; ... &quot;Awful. I wouldnt shop there again&quot; ... &quot;Very helpful&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-11-05: Wahoo! I am number one on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=datavision+sucks&quot;&gt;google for the phrase 'DataVision sucks'&lt;/a&gt;! Now there is some talented branding!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Introducing Windows 7.  Your PC, simplified.</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried out the Windows 7 Beta earlier this year. I had that sinking feeling in my gut when I realized that I would have to reinstall all my programs in order to move from Windows XP sp2 to WIndows 7 Beta. Apparently, the directory structures were not the same so the programs would not run. Or something. I sucked it up and installed a raft of development tools so that I could have the new OS. At least I was only going to have to do this once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I ran the upgrade installation program for Windows 7 Professional, I was surprised to get this message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Windows 7 Ultimate cannot be upgraded to Windows 7 Professional. You can choose to install a new copy of Windows 7 Professional instead, but this is different from an upgrade, and does not keep your files, settings, and programs. &lt;strong&gt;You'll need to reinstall any programs using the original installation discs or files.&lt;/strong&gt; To save your files before installing Windows, back them up to an external location such as a CD, DVD, or external hard drive. To install a new copy of Windows 7 Professional, click the Back button in the upper left-hand corner, and select &quot;Custom (advanced)&quot;.[EMphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think: should moving from Windows 7 Ultimate (beta) to Windows 7 Professional (release) require reinstallation of every non-operating system program on my machine? Would you go ahead or just return the upgrade package and wait until Microsoft gets its act together?&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>MoreLinq</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wanted a way to iterate over two sequences in LINQ the same way you do in functional languages like python. It's most commonly called zip() and it works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;seq = [fn(a1, b1) for a1, b1 in zip(a, b)]&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies a function fn() to each pair of variables pulled from a and b together. There is no direct way to do this in LINQ 3.5, but I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/morelinq/&quot;&gt;MoreLinq&lt;/a&gt; which has an implementation of zip() and many other useful functions.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>VB.NET code to implement Excel Rank()</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to implement the Excel function Rank() for a project. I came up with this templatized LINQ code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Public Class ReversedComparer(Of T As IComparable)
    Implements IComparer(Of T)
    Public Function Compare(ByVal x As T, ByVal y As T) As Integer _
    Implements System.Collections.Generic.IComparer(Of T).Compare
       Return -x.CompareTo(y)
    End Function
End Class

Private Shared Function BinarySearch(Of T As IComparable)(ByRef x() As T, _
                                     ByVal val As T, _
                                     ByVal comparer As IComparer(Of T)) As Integer
    Dim lo As Integer = 0, hi As Integer = x.Count - 1
    While lo &lt;= hi
        Dim mid As Integer = (hi + lo) \ 2
        If comparer.Compare(val, x(mid)) &lt;&gt; 1 Then
            hi = mid - 1
        Else
            lo = mid + 1
        End If
    End While
    Return CInt(If(comparer.Compare(x(lo), val) = 0, lo, -1))
End Function

Public Shared Function Rank(ByRef X() As Double) As Integer()
    Dim sorted() As Double = (From xx In X Order By xx Descending Select xx).ToArray()
     Dim comparer As IComparer(Of Double) = New ReversedComparer(Of Double)
     Return X.Select(Function(val) 1 + BinarySearch(Of Double)(sorted, val, comparer)).ToArray()
End Function
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's pretty good as far as it goes. It takes a copy of the data in reverse-sorted order and then does a binary search to find the 0-based position in the array for each element in the original array. And that's fine, but I wanted to implement something more like my python code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
import collections
def rank(arr):
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	&gt;&gt;&gt; a = list(range(10))
	&gt;&gt;&gt; print rank(a)
	[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
	&gt;&gt;&gt; b = list(range(10))
	&gt;&gt;&gt; b.reverse()
	&gt;&gt;&gt; print rank(b)
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [5] * 10
	&gt;&gt;&gt; print rank(c)
	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
	&gt;&gt;&gt; d = ([5] * 5) + ([1] * 5)
	&gt;&gt;&gt; d
	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
	&gt;&gt;&gt; print rank(d)
	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	d = collections.defaultdict(list)
	for i, v in enumerate(arr):
		d[v].append(i)
	result = [0] * len(arr)
	i = 1
	for k in sorted(d, reverse = True):
		for j in d[k]:
			result[j] = i
		i += len(d[k])
	return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
	import doctest
	doctest.testmod()
 &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I worked through the LINQ issues using the LinqPad interpreter and came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Function Rank(Of T)(Byref x() as T) as Integer()
    Dim original_pos = x.Select(Function(xx, index) New With {.Val = xx, .Index = index}) _
             .ToLookup(Function(xxx) xxx.Val)
    Dim keys = original_pos.OrderByDescending(Function(yy) yy.Key)    
    Dim result(x.Count-1) as Integer
    Dim i as Integer = 1
    For Each item in keys
        For Each v in item
            result(v.Index) = i
        Next
        i = i + item.Count
    Next
    Return result
End Function
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that's pretty good code: templatized LINQ code that uses lambda functions and implements the algorithm as quickly as I know how.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The return of CoWhereIs</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I wrote CoWhereIs in C/C++. It was a small program to search the registry for where a COM server was to be found. Back in the mists of time, this was something you needed to do from time to time if you were a COM developer, as I was. And somewhere along the way, I stopped needing to do that and I lost the source code. But it was no big problem because I was no longer working with COM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I find that I have some .NET code that implements user defined functions (UDFs) in Excel 2007 and it turns out that the integration between Excel and .NET is stuck in 2005: the code has to be exposed as a COM server that is installed with regasm on your machine. So now I need an installer and I need to test the installer to see if it is, in fact, calling regasm to patch the registry so that my .NET/COM server is actually available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I found myself rewriting CoWhereIs to search the registry. This time, I've written it in python because the times have changed. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;from __future__ import with_statement
from _winreg import *
import os.path

class MissingProgIDException(Exception):
    pass
class MissingCLSIDException(Exception):

            return QueryValue(h, &quot;&quot;)
    except WindowsError, err:
        print r&quot;Missing progID: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\%s&quot; % key
        raise MissingProgIDException()

def CoWhereIs(progID):
    clsid = getCLSID(progID)
    print &quot;ProgID %s is CLSID %s&quot; % (progID, clsid)
    key = r'CLSID\%s\InProcServer32' % clsid
    try:
        with OpenKey(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, key) as h2:
            location = QueryValueEx(h2, &quot;CodeBase&quot;)
            file_name = location[0].replace(&quot;file:///&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
            file_loc = file_name.replace(r'/', r'\\')
            print file_loc, &quot;: File exists?&quot;, os.path.exists(file_loc)
    except WindowsError, err:
        print r&quot;Missing CLSID: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\%s&quot; % key
        raise MissingCLSIDException()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
        try:
            CoWhereIs(arg)
        except:

&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>C# and const correctness</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;On a recent interview, I was asked: &quot;Why doesn't C# have keywords for const-correctness?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few answers. First, C# does have constants and &lt;em&gt;const&lt;/em&gt; class members. You can declare class members as &lt;em&gt;const&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;readonly&lt;/em&gt; to get compile-time and run-time constants, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's even possible to write classes that are immutable, so that you cannot modify an existing one but have to make a new one, possibly based on an existing one. It's like strings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;    s.replace(&quot;The&quot;, &quot;An&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;
does not modify the original string. Instead, you have to take the return value:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;    s = s.replace(&quot;The&quot;, &quot;An&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won't come as a great surprise to hear that I favor making classes immutable wherever they can be, as a means of clarifying their usage and to make them safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real question is: why doesn't C# have const methods (methods where the code promises not to modify class members) or methods that respect const parameters? The nearest I have found to an answer on that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artima.com/intv/choicesP.html&quot;&gt;Anders Hejlsberg in an online interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Immutables&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Venners&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to being a C# and CLR construct, the value type is a general object-oriented programming concept. Another such concept is immutable types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to the first JavaOne back in 1996, everyone seemed to have one complaint about what they missed from C++ that Java didn't have. Different people had different complaints, but they all seemed to have at least one complaint. My complaint was const. I really liked what I could do with const in C++, though somehow I have gotten along in Java just fine without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you consider including support for the concept of immutable directly in C# and the CLR?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anders Hejlsberg&lt;/strong&gt;: There are two questions in here. With respect to immutability, it's tricky because what you're saying when you say something is immutable, is that from an external perspective, I cannot observe any mutation. That doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have a cache inside that makes it go more efficiently. It's just on the outside it looks immutable. That's hard for a compiler to figure out. We could certainly have a rule that says you can only modify the fields of this object in the constructor. And we could make certain usability guarantees. But it actually rules out some scenarios that are in use. So we haven't codified immutability as a hard guarantee, because it's a hard guarantee to make. The concept of an immutable object is very useful, but it's just up to the author to say that it's immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Venners&lt;/strong&gt;: Immutability is part of the semantics of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anders Hejlsberg&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. With respect to const, it's interesting, because we hear that complaint all the time too: &quot;Why don't you have const?&quot; Implicit in the question is, &quot;Why don't you have const that is enforced by the runtime?&quot; That's really what people are asking, although they don't come out and say it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that const works in C++ is because you can cast it away. If you couldn't cast it away, then your world would suck. If you declare a method that takes a const Bla, you could pass it a non-const Bla. But if it's the other way around you can't. If you declare a method that takes a non-const Bla, you can't pass it a const Bla. So now you're stuck. So you gradually need a const version of everything that isn't const, and you end up with a shadow world. In C++ you get away with it, because as with anything in C++ it is purely optional whether you want this check or not. You can just whack the constness away if you don't like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees approach &quot;Immutability [as] part of the semantics of the class.&quot; They consider this the relevant feature, not semantics of individual methods of a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/04/22/118238.aspx&quot;&gt;Eric Gunnerson&lt;/a&gt; also considers const-correctness &quot;a good idea in the small, but doesn't work too well in the large.&quot; Furthermore, he points out that it is hard to enforce across multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many entries on StackOverFlow.com on this question (searchable &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=C%23+%22const+correctness%22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and the best answer provided is &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/528122/why-doesnt-c-offer-constness-akin-to-c&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect there are some practical reasons, and some theoretical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should the constness apply to the object or the reference? If it's in the reference, should this be compile-time only, or as a bit within the reference itself? Can something else which has a non-const reference to the same object fiddle with it under the hood?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would you want to be able to cast it away as you can in C++? That doesn't sound very much like something you'd want on a managed platform... but what about all those times where it makes sense in C++?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Syntax gets tricky (IMO) when you have more than one type involved in a declaration - think arrays, generics etc. It can become hard to work out exactly which bit is const.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can't cast it away, everyone has to get it right. In other words, both the .NET framework types and any other 3rd party libraries you use all have to do the right thing, or you're left with nasty situations where your code can't do the right thing because of a subtle problem with constness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a big one in terms of why it can't be supported now though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Backwards compatibility: there's no way all libraries would be correctly migrated to it, making it pretty much useless :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree it would be useful to have some sort of constness indicator, but I can't see it happening, I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, approaches you can use to get immutability at the class level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object&quot;&gt;immutable object pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Class is immutable by design, made so by the developer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;collections returned as AsReadOnly&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e78dcd75.aspx&quot;&gt;List&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53kysx7b.aspx&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/a&gt; generic classes both support this method.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;class members that are marked as &lt;em&gt;readonly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;const&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two would support immutable method parameters -- you could not change them in the scope of the function and get side-effects. But C++-style const-correctness on methods is not available by language syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Open source components</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I went to a django presentation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hugeinc.com/&quot;&gt;HUGE Inc. in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the highlight was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montylounge.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Fricovsky's&lt;/a&gt; five minute (well, ten minute) lightning talk in which he demonstrated the power of using open source components. He took a fairly small blog project of his and pulled it down from github.com. Then he used &lt;a href=&quot;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; to get the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Inside of ten minutes, he had a working blog that used five to ten open source components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this, I got a big reality check on using open source code. I wanted to try out some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevesouders.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Souders's ideas on improving website performance&lt;/a&gt; on a django open source project that is already running. I forked some code from github and was going to apply &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mintchaos/django_compressor/tree/master&quot;&gt;django-compressor&lt;/a&gt; to the CSS and JS to see the performance improvement. I never got to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was missing a couple of important pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a list of the requirements and how to obtain them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the settings.py file to list the installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without these, I was pretty much dead. I soldiered on, though, and found eight required components to add, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;one of the components did not work with python 2.5 at head rev&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I got a subtle templetags error message that I eventually realized meant that I had a wrong similarly-named open source component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written to the project author to find out where to get the correct component.
It's a bracing counterpoint to the presentation. Taking your own code and adding components -- likely to work. Taking a project in an unknown state and trying to back out what the components are -- much more likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3349&quot;&gt;message like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
'XXX' is not a valid tag library: Could not load template library from django.templatetags.XXX, No module named models&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then I have a technique for you. Assuming that templatetags module XXX has a ton of import statements in its files, you have to figure out which file it is importing that is causing the failure. Take code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
from django import template
from django.conf import settings
from django.core import template_loader
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
from syncr.twitter.models import Tweet
from syncr.delicious.models import Bookmark
from syncr.flickr.models import Photo
from tagging.templatetags import tagging_tags
from tumblr.models import TumblrPost
from lastfm.models import LastfmPost
import re
import datetime
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and turn it into this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
try:
    from django import template
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.core import template_loader
    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
    from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
    from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
except ImportError, exc:
    print &quot;django error in %s: %s&quot; % (__file__, exc)

try:
    from syncr.twitter.models import Tweet
    from syncr.delicious.models import Bookmark
    from syncr.flickr.models import Photo
    from tagging.templatetags import tagging_tags
    from tumblr.models import TumblrPost
    from lastfm.models import LastfmPost
except ImportError, exc:
    print &quot;package error in %s: %s&quot; % (__file__, exc)

try:
    import re
    import datetime
except ImportError, exc:
    print &quot;python error in %s: %s&quot; % (__file__, exc)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this for every file in the module. Run the dev server and watch for the import error location reported. Once you know which block is failing in which file, add print statements to see which particular import you get to before it fails. Then you'll know which import is not working. In my case, this showed me that I had used the wrong open source tumblr module for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/dec/04/magic-tags/&quot;&gt;James Bennett&lt;/a&gt; has some more detailed observations on this point, too.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Recent reading</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of reading recently. Here are Django books I've finished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Python-Development-Django-Developers-Library/dp/0132356139/&quot;&gt;Python Web Development with Django&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Django-Template-Development-Scott-Newman/dp/1847195709/&quot;&gt;Django 1.0 Template Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Django-Experts-Voice-Development/dp/1430210478/&quot;&gt;Pro Django&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are general web development books I've read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309/&quot;&gt;High Performance Web Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Even-Faster-Web-Sites-Performance/dp/0596522304/&quot;&gt;Even Faster Web Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Interfaces-Principles-Interactions/dp/0596516258/&quot;&gt;Designing Web Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a book on Git: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Version-Control-Git-collaborative-development/dp/0596520123/&quot;&gt;Version Control with Git&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, here are the books I am currently reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Google-Mashups-Mapplets-GeoRSS/dp/1430216204/&quot;&gt;Beginning Google Maps Mashups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-applications/dp/0596102356/&quot;&gt;Building Scalable Web Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Django-Projects-Second-Bennett/dp/1430219386/&quot;&gt;Practical django Projects, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly recommend Pro Django for django developers. It is advanced and offers a lot of insight into django and the python techniques it is built on.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Binary search coding test</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I had an interview in which I was asked to &quot;find an integer in a sorted array or integers if it was present.&quot; This is obviously a binary search, so I coded up this (but in C/C++):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
def binarysearch(iter, val):
	lo, hi = 0, len(iter)-1
	while lo &lt;= hi:
		mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
		if iter[mid] &gt;= val :
			hi = mid - 1
		else:
			lo = mid + 1
	return (lo if iter[lo] == val else -1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things that make this noteworthy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculation of &lt;em&gt;mid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you calculate the midpoint of the array in the more straightforward way (&lt;em&gt;mid = (lo + hi) / 2&lt;/em&gt;), then you risk integer overflow when working with fixed sized integers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of a single comparison in the loop&lt;p&gt;
It seems that you should actually test for an exact match on finding the element you are searching for. This is not so. More below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning &lt;em&gt;iter[lo]&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;iter[mid]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is not necessary to keep track of the last midpoint. When you fall out of the loop, either &lt;em&gt;iter[lo]&lt;/em&gt; is the desired value or the value was not found in the array. If it is found, then in an array that has multiple instances of the value, &lt;em&gt;lo&lt;/em&gt; is the location of the first occurrence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on point two that the interview went a bit astray. The interviewer wanted to see code that looked more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
def binarysearch(iter, val):
	lo, hi = 0, len(iter)-1
	while lo &lt;= hi:
		mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
		if iter[mid] == val :
			return mid
		elif iter[mid] &gt; val:
			hi = mid - 1
		else:
			lo = mid + 1
	return -1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all very well -- it's a correct algorithm -- but it's not as efficient. In my algorithm, there is only one comparison per loop. In the other, there is either one if there is a match or two on a failure. For comparison purposes and to make this concrete, let's imagine we have an array or 63 elements and we look for every element of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cost of my code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
63 nodes searched * 6 comparisons per search
378 comparisons&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h3&gt;Cost of other code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
1 nodes searched * 1 comparisons = 1
2 nodes searched * 3 comparisons = 6
4 nodes searched * 5 comparisons = 20
8 nodes searched * 7 comparisons = 56
16 nodes searched * 9 comparisons = 144
32 nodes searched * 11 comparisons = 352
579 comparisons&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So contrary to the expectations of the interviewer, it is actually more efficient to search to the end of the array every time using fewer comparisons than to search less of the array with more comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Metric stupidity</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;What are you supposed to do when you see something so flagrantly wrong as this (&lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/107235/10-pricey-cities-that-pay-off.html?mod=realestate-buy&quot;&gt;Yahoo: Ten Pricey Cities that Pay Off&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;When you pay a lot of money for something, you hope to get a lot of value in return. Despite the housing downturn and the number of cheap houses it has left in its wake, there is still plenty of expensive land left. According to the Global Property Guide, an online real estate investor's guide, New York might have slipped from the second-most-expensive city in the world in 2008 to the sixth most expensive in 2009, but an average &lt;strong&gt;120-square-meter (373-square-foot)&lt;/strong&gt; apartment in the central business district will still cost you a hefty $14,898 per square meter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A square meter is not about 3 square feet. It's more than 10 square feet. You take the number of feet per meter (3.28 feet / meter) and square that to get the square feet per square meter (10.76 square feet / square meter). Is that so hard? The cited apartment is more like 1300 square feet, assuming the journalist got this original fact right.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Finnair fan fares</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Finnair advertised today in amNewYork that it had fares to Asia: Seoul, Beijing, and Shanghai for $848; Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya for $948. Let's leave out for a minute that you can't see these fares listed on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finnair.com/us/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. I find it fascinating that Finnair is flying people from New York to Asia via Helsinki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Now you can fly Finnair's brand new aircraft from New York (JFK) via Helsinki (HEL) to Asia at a very good price.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't it a lot farther this way? Concretely, how far is it from JFK to TYO via HEL versus the direct route? Fortunately, the web has the answer. Using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle&quot;&gt;great circle&lt;/a&gt;, the most direct route on our ovoid planet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=JFK-HEL-TYO%0D%0A&amp;RANGE=&amp;PATH-COLOR=red&amp;PATH-UNITS=mi&amp;PATH-MINIMUM=&amp;SPEED-GROUND=&amp;SPEED-UNITS=kts&amp;RANGE-STYLE=best&amp;RANGE-COLOR=navy&amp;MAP-STYLE=&quot;&gt;JFK-HEL-TYO&lt;/a&gt; is 8981 miles. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=JFK-TYO%0D%0A&amp;RANGE=&amp;PATH-COLOR=red&amp;PATH-UNITS=mi&amp;PATH-MINIMUM=&amp;SPEED-GROUND=&amp;SPEED-UNITS=kts&amp;RANGE-STYLE=best&amp;RANGE-COLOR=navy&amp;MAP-STYLE=&quot;&gt;JFK-TYO&lt;/a&gt; is 6763 miles. So the Finnair route is about one-third longer. I guess that's good if you are accumulating air miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how long does this actually take? I went to Sidestep.com to look up a hypothetical JFK-TYO flight leaving 2009-06-23 and returning 2009-06-30. Northwest quotes a JFK-NRT return flight for $848 that takes 14:10 outbound and 12:40 on the return. Finnair's flight leaves JFK at 17:40 and arrives at HEL at 08:50 the next day. I think that's 15 hours less 6 hours for timezones or 9 hours. Then there is an 8:30 layover before the flight leaves HEL at 17:20 and arrives at NRT at 08:55 the following day. I'm not certain of the math, but it sounds like you could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;take Northwest and leave JFK at 13:50 and arrive at NRT at 17:00+1 day or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;take Finnair and leave JFK at 17:40 and arrive at NRT at 08:55+2 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Finnair, you leave 4 hours later and arrive 16 hours later, for a trip that is 12 hours longer: 26 hours on Finnair versus 14 hours on Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's cheaper on Northwest anyway: Northwest for $848 versus Finnair for the advertised price of $948 or the Finnair.com's current price of $1178.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on cost, time, and distance, this is a non-starter. It just doesn't make any sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been to a fair number of technical conferences and presentations recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2009-05-18 Enterprise Developer Conference&lt;br /&gt;
Followed the user experience and WPF tracks. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://entdevcon.telligent.com/&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009-05-29 WPF Line of Business&lt;br /&gt;
Microsoft 2 day presentation on WPF. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/jaimer/archive/2009/04/01/announcing-the-using-wpf-to-build-lob-applications-training-tour.aspx&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009-06-08 Wintellect.com's Mastering WPF&lt;br /&gt;
A two-day web presentation by Walt Ritscher on WPF. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wintellect.com/CourseDetail.aspx?Course=41&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been fairly active in Meetup.com groups, following the latest developments in the python, .NET, and the ALT.NET communities. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/members/7521380/&quot;&gt;Meetup profile&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no substantive Unix on my resume, but recently I have been doing a lot with Ubuntu (Hardy and Jaunty) because I have been deploying my Django applications to Apache. I've installed Ubuntu with Apache and development tools to my laptop, a home server, a server at slicehost.net, and a server at webfaction.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also started to push out my projects as open source on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/hughdbrown&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. So far, all of the work is in python and django. The django work has given me a chance to brush up on my web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I am always forgetting how to do dictionary construction. Here is a piece of code I restructured for a friend. Notice that the dictionary is created from a sequence of tuples. (Slightly modified from the original for better pretty-printing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
def slug_to_lower(fn):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Decorator to lowercase string arguments to a function.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    import string
    def is_string(x):
        return isinstance(x, str) or isinstance(x, unicode)
    def trans(x):
        return (x if not is_string(x) else string.lower(x))
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        neo_args = [trans(x) for x in args]
        tuple_list = [(k,trans(v)) for k,v in kwargs.items()]
        neo_kwargs = dict(tuple_list)
        return fn(*neo_args, **neo_kwargs)
    return wrapped
&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>The things I don't know about python</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I amaze myself with what I don't know. Here is a simple case: in python, you can pass a function a dictionary with keys with the same name as the function's arguments. For some reason, I thought this was only available when you identified keyword arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(a, b) :
...     return a + b
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(2, 5)
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'a':2, 'b':5}
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(**d)
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>Getting github working in Windows</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;What a nightmare. I generated an SSH key on Windows with puttygen to submit to github but I could not get &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt; to retrieve the code I had authored. (Somehow, I'd managed to put the initial revision up and then broken things -- perhaps with a clone using the general URL.) Using &lt;em&gt;SSH -vi &amp;lt;key&amp;gt; github.com&lt;/em&gt; did not help -- I still got &lt;i&gt;Permission denied (public key)&lt;/i&gt; errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up generating the SSH key on Ubuntu, copying that into github, and confirming that I could SSH to github.com. Here were my steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
# Generate the rsa keys
cd ~
ssh-keygen -t rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.*
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Copy public key to clipboard, paste into github
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

# Test: connect to github through console
ssh -F config -vi ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub github.com

# Actually clone the source
cd ~/src
git clone git@github.com:username/project.git
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I wanted to get &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt; working on my Windows box. &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/guides/addressing-authentication-problems-with-ssh&quot;&gt;This web page&lt;/a&gt; was instructive. Once I realized that the message meant that it could not find the key and that the default location is &lt;i&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/i&gt;, I copied the keys to &lt;em&gt;.ssh&lt;/em&gt; under my home directory on Windows. Doh! You get it? The tilde stands for &lt;em&gt;c:\users\username&lt;/em&gt; on Vista and Windows 7 and &lt;em&gt;c:\Documents and Settings\username&lt;/em&gt; in Windows 2000 and XP. It's just not a Windows convention to use tilde -- or to use directory names that start with a period. For good measure, I added a config file for that directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Host github.com
  User git
  Port 22
  Hostname github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  TCPKeepAlive yes
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if you copy your RSA key files to &lt;em&gt;C:\Program files\git\.ssh&lt;/em&gt; with the config file above, you can then run this command to make sure all is well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&quot;C:\Program files\git\bin\ssh&quot; -vi id_rsa.pub -F config git@github.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you'll be asked to confirm the github.com signature, prompted for the public key's signature three times (and since you made it without a password, you'll just hit ENTER three times), and get a message that there is no shell acccess to github. I think that there will then be a &lt;em&gt;known_hosts&lt;/em&gt; file in the &lt;em&gt;.ssh&lt;/em&gt; directory and the keys will have been copied to &lt;em&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/em&gt;. Copy the config file there for good measure and you should be able to run &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt; to push code from your source directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009-06-08: I had to revisit this today. I could not connect on a Windows box because it was picking up the wrong &lt;em&gt;ssh&lt;/em&gt; from my path. The workaround is to set the exact one desired using the environment variable, GIT_SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently visited my 6 year old nephew, and I thought I'd report back on the significant markers in a young boy's world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;police cars&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;snakes and spiders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;sharks and alligators&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;sandcastles and beaches&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;rocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lego&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;macaroni and cheese, pizza&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ice cream and cookies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spiderman and Batman&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;chocolate milk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you can just talk about these things, you'll certainly keep his attention.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Python code to find duplicate texts on google</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across an accusation of plagiarism on the web today and thought it would be interesting to code up some python that finds candidate texts that are plagiarisms of the reference text. The obvious idea: query google for matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing was to find the unusual words that would form the google signature. I tracked down a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists&quot;&gt;English word frequencies&lt;/a&gt; and saved it to disk. Then I wrote code to load the reference text into memory and to count occurrences of each word. Then the top-scoring words are the ones that occur much more frequently than expected in the word frequency list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloads: &lt;a href=&quot;/files/plagiarism.py&quot;&gt;plagiarism.py&lt;/a&gt; &amp;bull; &lt;a href=&quot;/files/wordfreq.txt&quot;&gt;word frequency file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Shim Sham for Frankie's birthday</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lori and I performed in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_sham&quot;&gt;shim sham&lt;/a&gt; at Grand Central in March. Yehoodi, a local dance group, got together about 50-100 people on a Saturday afternoon to perform for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frankie95.com/&quot;&gt;Frankie Manning's 95th birthday&lt;/a&gt;. We assembled in the main hall, but the large presence of so many related people dressed in vintage and the slowness with which we worked allowed the train station security to shut us down. They directed us to a cramped and out of the way location where we were permitted to dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the performance on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEKkppATZN0&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. Lori and I are way at the back -- I'm on the left and Lori's on the right. Or at least, that's what I remember. We're not particularly visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we went over to TKTS in Time Square and did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGEOaSlwyb0&quot;&gt;real performance&lt;/a&gt; on the steps. At least, Lori did -- I elected to watch from the side. (The first half of the performance has not been posted -- not sure why.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an ambition to learn the shim sham, I think that Mandy Gould of Toronto has the best instructional video on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOvTidi0leM&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200905/imf-advice&quot;&gt;The Quiet Coup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States. One of the most alarming, says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government--a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets, and is at the center of many emerging-market crises. If the IMF's staff could speak freely about the U.S., it would tell us what it tells all countries in this situation: recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we're running out of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Expanding archive listings</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've changed the HTML of my HTML header and archive pages so that the monthly archives and category archives do not display expanded. Instead, they are presented contracted and can be expanded with a click on the respective headers. It bugged me that the pages for these were so long when the archives are not necessarily used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-03-27: I did the same thing for Recent Comments and Recent Entries. Here are the required edits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recent Comments widget&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recent Entries widget&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Monthly Archives widget&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Category Archives widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in bold, metanames in italics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint  lang-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;    &amp;lt;a href=&quot;javascript:animatedcollapse.toggle('&lt;em&gt;WidgetId&lt;/em&gt;')&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &amp;lt;h3 class=&quot;widget-header&quot;&amp;gt;Monthly Archives&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&lt;strong&gt;    &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &amp;lt;div &lt;strong&gt;id=&quot;&lt;em&gt;WidgetId&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; class=&quot;widget-content&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HTML Head template
&lt;p&gt;Add javascript to the HEAD section of the page. 'divs' matches the names given to each of the div elements in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint  lang-js&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;

                <title>Our Epistemological Depression</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;History professor Jerry Z. Muller of The Catholic University of America contends that &lt;a href=&quot;http://american.com/archive/2009/our-epistemological-depression&quot;&gt;much of the current financial debacle is epistemological in nature&lt;/a&gt; -- that it was a failure of the financial actors to understand what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diversification of investment, which was intended to reduce risk to institutional investors, ended up spreading risk more widely, as investors across the country and around the world found themselves holding mortgage-backed American securities of declining and indeterminate value. There was a belief in the financial sector that diversification of assets was a substitute for due diligence on each asset, so that if one bundled enough assets together, one didn't have to know much about the assets themselves. The creation of securities based on a pool of diverse assets (mortgage loans, student loans, credit card receivables, etc.) meant that when markets declined radically, it became impossible to determine an accurate price for the security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of top management, the diversity of operations means that executives were managing assets and services with which they have little familiarity. This has led to the spread of pseudo-objectivity: the search for standardized measures of achievement across large and disparate organizations. Its implicit premises were these: that information which is numerically measurable is the only sort of knowledge necessary; that numerical data can substitute for other forms of inquiry; and that numerical acumen can substitute for practical knowledge about the underlying assets and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Experimental economics in the classroom</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/200812/financial-bubbles&quot;&gt;The Atlantic Monthly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on experimental economics discoveries in trading: it always ends in a bubble and a crash, even if the security has a predictable and definite value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about a laboratory experiment is that you can control the environment. Wall Street securities carry uncertainties--more, lately, than many people expected--but this experimental security is a sure thing. &quot;The fundamental value is unambiguously defined,&quot; says the economist Charles Noussair, a professor at Tilburg University, in the Netherlands, who has run many of these experiments. &quot;It's the expected value of the future dividend stream at any given time&quot;: 15 times 24 cents, or $3.60 at the end of the first round; 14 times 24 cents, or $3.36 at the end of the second; $3.12 at the end of the third; and so on down to zero. Participants don't even have to do the math. They can see the total expected dividends on their computer screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, finally, is a security with security--no doubt about its true value, no hidden risks, no crazy ups and downs, no bubbles and panics. The trading price should stick close to the expected value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that's what economists would have thought before Vernon Smith, who won a 2002 Nobel Prize for developing experimental economics, first ran the test in the mid-1980s. But that's not what happens. Again and again, in experiment after experiment, &lt;strong&gt;the trading price runs up way above fundamental value. Then, as the 15th round nears, it crashes.&lt;/strong&gt; The problem doesn't seem to be that participants are bored and fooling around. The difference between a good trading performance and a bad one is about $80 for a three-hour session, enough to motivate cash-strapped students to do their best. &lt;strong&gt;Besides, Noussair emphasizes, &quot;you don't just get random noise. You get bubbles and crashes.&quot; Ninety percent of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasis mine.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Words I've learned recently</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've started to do crossword puzzles in the newspapers, and I've picked up some unusual words. Here is my short list of new words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jingproject.com/download/pc/&quot;&gt;Jing&lt;/a&gt; being used at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.screencast.com&quot;&gt;ScreenCast&lt;/a&gt; for recording onscreen demos. It's free so I'm going to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also had recommendations for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp&quot;&gt;Camtasia&lt;/a&gt;. I may try the demo for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>SSD RAID Super Computer</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Today's geek moment: IT staffers assemble a computer that uses 24 Samsung 256-GB solid state drives in a RAID configuration, creating a 6 TB drive that flies. Ripping a DVD to disk takes less time than a disk takes to fall out the window to the ground.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Wall Street on the Tundra </title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/04/iceland200904&quot;&gt;Wall Street on the Tundra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting article on Iceland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Just after October 6, 2008, when Iceland effectively went bust, I spoke to a man at the International Monetary Fund who had been flown in to Reykjavík to determine if money might responsibly be lent to such a spectacularly bankrupt nation. He'd never been to Iceland, knew nothing about the place, and said he needed a map to find it. He has spent his life dealing with famously distressed countries, usually in Africa, perpetually in one kind of financial trouble or another. Iceland was entirely new to his experience: a nation of extremely well-to-do (No. 1 in the United Nations' 2008 Human Development Index), well-educated, historically rational human beings who had organized themselves to commit one of the single greatest acts of madness in financial history. &quot;You have to understand,&quot; he told me, &quot;Iceland is no longer a country. It is a hedge fund.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Canadian passport photo in New York City</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/files/passport(2009)214x291.jpg&quot; /&gt;If you are getting a Canadian passport photo taken in New York City, you should not even think about getting it done anywhere but at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doicamera.com/passport.html#canada&quot;&gt;Doi Camera&lt;/a&gt;. I've gone to lots of Fedex and UPS stores. I've visited the photo counters of pharmacies. Notwithstanding that they all purport to take passport photos, they do not take them to Canadian passport standards. The major failings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wrong size
&lt;p&gt;Canadian passport photos have to be 70mm x 50mm. American passport photos are 2&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot;, and this is not even remotely close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Presence of disqualifying anomalies
&lt;p&gt;Canadian passport photos have strict rules about the lighting and the absence of shadows and reflections. You are not going to get a good photo at any of these places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passport Canada lists 25 separate reasons for rejecting your submitted passport photo, including a catchall category, Other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, most commercial passport photo places in New York cannot do the size and quality, either. I've visited a few. They may even tell you over the phone that they can do the photos but they can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, your best choice is Doi Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watermark added with Paint.NET and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/181442/how_to_add_a_watermark_to_your_digital.html?cat=59&quot;&gt;instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>ImprovEverywhere: high five escalator</title>
                <description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;For our [ImprovEverywhere's] latest mission, Agent Lathan gave out 2,000 high fives by standing next to a subway escalator during the morning rush. Five additional agents spread out along the adjacent stairs, holding signs that prepared commuters for the upcoming high five fun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gigapan.org/&quot;&gt;GigaPan&lt;/a&gt; has huge high resolution panoramas on its website that are zoomable down to very low detail.

                <title>Generating sitemap files</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I moved my site to a new ISP. Normally, this would not involve resubmitting to search engines, but I had to change the URL to include my blog name, so the URLs were all changed. Hence, the resubmission problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submitting to google, yahoo, and a few others was the same, but when I tried ask.com, I realized that the protocol had changed in the past few years. Instead of giving one of the search engines the URL of your site, it has become increasingly common to require that the site have a sitemap file that lists all of the URLs that you wish to have submitted. Since I could not find code to do this, I rolled my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;/files/sitemap.py.txt&quot;&gt;sitemap.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Based on protocol specification &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Directory walking classes adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.activestate.com/recipes/528904/&quot;&gt;recipe at ActiveState.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

For Sitemaps:  http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd
For Sitemap index files: http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/siteindex.xsd

 The Sitemap must:

    * Specify the namespace (protocol standard) within the &lt;urlset&gt; tag.

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview that the torrent of money flowing into hedge funds has coincided with a troubling erosion in lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Geithner, who has been deeply involved in the effort, said in the interview that regulators want to make sure that major U.S. banks and brokerage firms &quot;can comfortably manage&quot; a shock to the system, such as a big hedge-fund failure.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Submitting to the search engines</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?as_rq=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Faddurl%2F&quot;&gt;find the search engine submission pages&lt;/a&gt;. This is not nearly so obvious as you'd think. Many search engines make it really hard to find their site submission pages. That's why I ended up relying on links to pages similar to Google's submission page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/addurl/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx&quot;&gt;Windows Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/site/help/webmasters&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL and a few of the others rely on Yahoo for submission, and the page they link to does not actually allow submission. Ay ay ay.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Going Under</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=b5662189-417e-4576-83fd-33bd98e74cd6&amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Going Under: A doctor's downfall, and a profession's struggle with addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2003, Brent Cambron gave himself his first injection of morphine. Save for the fact that he was sticking the needle into his own skin, the motion was familiar--almost rote. Over the course of the previous 17 months, as an anesthesia resident at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Cambron had given hundreds of injections. He would stick a syringe into a glass ampule of fentanyl or morphine or Dilaudid, pulling up the plunger to draw his dose. Then he'd inject the dose into his patient. If the patient had been in a panic before her surgery, Cambron would watch her drift into a pleasant, happy daze; if the patient had been moaning in pain after surgery, he'd watch the relief spread across her face as the pain went away. It was understandable, perhaps, that Cambron was curious to experience these sensations himself, to feel what his patients felt once the drugs began coursing through their bodies. It could even be considered a clinical experiment of sorts. &quot;I had thought about it for a long time,&quot; he later confessed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Moved to hostmysite.com</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So if you are reading this, then you have been successfully redirected to my new website on hostmysite.com. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole adventure was not without some complications and extra steps. Partly, it was the change of internet host. In addition, I was changing from Movable Type 4.21 to MT 4.23, from Microsoft IIS to Apache, and from Windows to Linux. All of these factors contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;mt-config.cgi
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problems flowed from the new mt-config.cgi file. Every Movable Type site has a mt-config.cgi file which describes where the CGI/Perl files can be found, where the generated static HTML files should go, and what the IP/URL of the website is. I was previously using MT under Microsoft IIS, and it allowed certain configuration errors that will haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT is designed to allow multiple blogs to share a single domain. Typically, your blog is rooted at http://www.domain.com/blogname/index.html. In my case, I had mine rooted at http://www.domain.com/index.html because I put the MT code and generated files into a directory hierarchy that omitted the blog name. Unfortunately, that is really not possible in a typical Linux installation, as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux sites set up (interpreted, executable) CGI files under /cgi-bin/ and (static, uninterpreted) HTML files under /htdocs/. Thus, you end up with your mt-static directory moved under htdocs and everything else put under cgi-bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything would still be cool if either:&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I omitted the directory with the blog name (putting everything in the htdocs root) or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I could find a way to configure mt-config.cgi to redirect to index.html without the blog name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; Neither seemed desirable, so I now have iwebthereforeiam stuck between my domain and all pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Hard-coded iwebthereforeiam.com / missing blog name
&lt;p&gt;Because of the change above, I could not have internal links that omitted the blog name. At a minimum, I had to change all these internal links. All of them used my domain name, so for simplicity, I just replaced the domain name with &lt;strong&gt;../..&lt;/strong&gt;. That will work even if I someday discover a simple way to omit the blog name from URLs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Move static HTML/ASP files
&lt;p&gt;Because of laziness, I had placed many files into the root of my configuration. In most cases, it was easier to just put them into a new directory /htdocs/files/. In like fashion, I ended up adding some other directories to the root so that I did not go insane patching my entire site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;/files/&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;/images/&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;/projects/&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;/sounds/&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;/styles/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Fix Movable Type templates
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of CSS and JavaScript packages on my site that have to be added to parts of the MT templates in order to flow through directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;google-analytics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;code coloring with prettify.js and prettify.css&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;snapshots from snap.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;blockquote.quote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have followed the instructions I posted some months ago for this, but MT 4.23 has removed some templates and added others, so I ended up figuring it out from scratch again. The gist of it is that anywhere that MT generates a &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt; section, I needed to include the CSS and JS files, and anywhere that MT generates a &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; section, I needed to add an &lt;em&gt;onload&lt;/em&gt; setting. The color coding involved adding the CSS and JavaScript inclusions to HTML Head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/mt-static/css/prettify.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/mt-static/js/prettify.js&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then adding &lt;em&gt;onload=&quot;prettyPrint();&quot;&lt;/em&gt; to the body element of these templates:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Search results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comment Preview&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Category Entry Listing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Monthly Entry Listing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up google analytics and snap.com involved making modifications to the bottom of the template &lt;em&gt;Banner Footer&lt;/em&gt;. I still have not got blockquote.quote in extra.css working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Add banned sites using mt_ipbanlist
&lt;p&gt;I have a huge collection of banned spammers from my previous site. I was not going to let them start spamming my trackbacks again, so I have to insert all these IP addresses into the MySQL table mt_ipbanlist. This will be a bit of a pain. I'll probably write a python script that does the insertions and upload the script to MySQL and let it chew on that for awhile. I imagine that must be how I did it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Rewrite ASP pages
&lt;p&gt;SInce I was under Microsoft IIS for so long, I have old ASP pages that will have to be rewritten, probably in PHP. I'll have to evaluate why they had to be ASP (i.e. interpreted/dynamic ) in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Redirect name servers
&lt;p&gt;This was the final step in throwing the switch. Once I did this, web surfers could find my new site with the old domain name. I had to add in an HTML file with a redirect to deal with the absence of the blog name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;REFRESH&quot; 
content=&quot;3; url=http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Redirecting to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;new blog location&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in 3 seconds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Alert the search engines
&lt;p&gt;Because of the addition of the blog name to the middle of the URL, most all URLs in the search engines are now bad. Sigh. So I have to resubmit my site for spidering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-01-09: Unbelievable. The whole problem with the blockquote.quote style in extra.css was that the file began with a C++-style comment and the entire file was interpreted as if it was commented out. Some sort of Unix versus Windows/LF versus CR-LF issue. Totally resolved by taking out the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How to install Movable Type on Linux</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;These instructions assume you have a Linux account and that you are using Apache as a webserver. Admittedly, they are based on the instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/installation/detailed-instructions.html&quot;&gt;Linux installation at Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, you are going to have a directory structure like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostmysite.com/support/linux/general/directorystructure/&quot;&gt;What is the directory structure of my Linux website?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;htdocs
&lt;p&gt;The htdocs directory is your main web directory. All files placed in this directory are visible in a web browser. When building your website, you want to place your files within this directory. The server knows to look in this directory so you do not need to specify htdocs in your code. When uploading your website through FTP, you will need to change into the htdocs directory on the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cgi-bin
&lt;p&gt;The cgi-bin directory is the one exception for your web files; all cgi scripts must be placed within the cgi-bin directory. Your cgi scripts will not run correctly if placed within the htdocs directory. Separating the cgi-bin and htdocs directories allows us to place proper permissions on the cgi-bin directory without impacting the performance of the htdocs directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not especially intuitive conclusion is that you have to split up your Movable Type installation: put mt-static into &lt;em&gt;/htdocs/&lt;/em&gt; and everything else into &lt;em&gt;/cgi-bin/&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ftp Movable Type installation to /mt directory.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move /mt/mt-static to /htdocs/mt-static.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move /mt to /cgi-bin/mt.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open http://&amp;lt;your domain&amp;gt;/cgi-bin/mt/mt.cgi in browser and start MT configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Aquatic Reptile Water Conditioner as dechlorinator</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.zilla-rules.com/assets/003/9562_200wh.jpg&quot; /&gt;Recently, I wanted a product to take the chlorine out of swimwear. The products on offer were fairly expensive -- typically $5 (plus shipping and handling) for a 2 ounce bottle of dechlorinator. But I discovered that the mystery ingredient is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiosulfate&quot;&gt;sodium thiosulfate&lt;/a&gt;, so it was a simple matter to find some other product that uses the same ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it is also used as a dechlorinator for water for pets, and the cheapest source is R-Zilla's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zilla-rules.com/products/aquatic-reptile-water-conditioner.htm&quot;&gt;Aquatic Reptile Water Conditioner&lt;/a&gt; which costs $10 for 8 ounces at my local petstore. So now I am using this to take the chlorine out of my swimsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Flight of the Conchords season 2 premiere</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo returns to HBO for a second season. Season 2 Online Premiere available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/c48f423bdf/season-2-online-premiere-flight-of-the-conchords-from-flight-of-the-conchords&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brett: Are you living in your car, Murray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray: No. Of course not. It's illegal. You can't do that. Apparently. Unless you move your vehicle every three hours. [Beeping] I've got to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Put the credit default swaps market out of its misery</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Argument for unwinding all the credit default swaps and closing the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three possible defences for treating the CDS market as a going concern: its support for capital raising, its utility for price discovery and its role as a risk-management tool. All have melted like so many Lehman deal cubes in waste incinerators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider capital raising. Writers of protection in the CDS market must now hold increasing amounts of cash as margin against the probability of default for the &quot;reference entities&quot; or borrowers they bet on. This has led to the sale of tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars, euros and pounds worth of securities to raise that cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads to the value of such swaps for price discovery. Bad joke. Price discovery is a useful economic function; that is the rationale for commodities markets. But CDS are derivative instruments, whose price is &quot;discovered&quot; these days as a function of equity volatility, since buying equity puts is one way to dynamically hedge the illiquid legacy books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk management with CDS was largely about what the bankers called &quot;reg cap arb&quot; (regulatory capital arbitrage), or making big spreads and bonuses by scamming the regulators whose employers, the taxpayers, now have the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw the concert film, &lt;em&gt;Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man&lt;/em&gt;. It's a great tribute to the songs of Leonard Cohen, Canadian poet and songwriter from Montreal. There are a half dozen songs that are well worth the film:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm Your Man&lt;/em&gt; (Cohen's version, sung over the ending credits)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everybody Knows&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Knows_(Leonard_Cohen_song)&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:Five minutes, thirty-seven seconds in duration, &lt;em&gt;Everybody Knows&lt;/em&gt; is known for its somber tone and repetition of the title at the beginning of most verses. Featuring phrases such as &quot;Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a long-stemmed rose...&quot;, &lt;em&gt;Everybody Knows&lt;/em&gt; has been variously described by critics as &quot;bitterly pessimistic&quot; yet funny, or, more strongly, a &quot;bleak prophecy about the end of the world as we know it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Traitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suzanne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hallelujah&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Hallelujah&lt;/em&gt; is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen originally released on his 1984 studio album Various Positions. A live recording of the song from 1988, containing additional lyrics, appears on the 1994 album, Cohen Live. While &lt;em&gt;Suzanne&lt;/em&gt; is his most covered work to date, &lt;em&gt;Hallelujah&lt;/em&gt; has experienced great popularity more recently and has now been recorded more than 170 times for release and has been featured in the soundtracks of numerous movies and television shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tower of Song&lt;/em&gt; (Leonard Cohen backed by U2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>New hardware firewall</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So I wanted a new hardware firewall. The old SonicWall SOHO/10 works fine. It's very low maintenance. However, it has only four ports and runs at 10 mbps. I think it's the bottleneck in our network, and since I am getting another computer, I figured it was time to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at these hardware firewalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3032704&amp;sku=D700-2308&amp;srkey=D-Link%20DIR%20130&quot;&gt;D-Link DIR-130 NetDefend - 8-Port 10/100 VPN Firewall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=405220&amp;sku=N100-1424&amp;srkey=FVS318&quot;&gt;Netgear FVS318 10/100 Mbps 8-Port VPN/Firewall Router&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=1533875&amp;sku=L48-2354&amp;srkey=Linksys%20RV082&quot;&gt;Linksys - RV082 - 8-Port VPN Router with Load Balancing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2493260&amp;CatId=1409&quot;&gt;WatchGuard - WG50010 - Firebox Edge X10e - 6-Port VPN Firewall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=1209349&amp;sku=N100-1652&amp;srkey=Netgear%20FVX538&quot;&gt;Netgear - FVX538 - ProSafe 8-Port VPN Firewall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inexplicably, I selected the one with the worst rating at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Der Untergang&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) recast as a financial crisis at an investment bank headed by Adolf Hitler. The reconstructed plot and dialogue, supported by subtitles, are brilliant and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is practically a cottage industry built on parodies of &lt;em&gt;Der Untergang&lt;/em&gt;. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNmcf4Y3lGM&amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;one-off video&lt;/a&gt; also inspired by the current financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No problem. I'll just refinance my adjustable rate mortgage and then I'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate only goes UP! My broker told me it only goes UP! I can't believe I am going to have to sell my house before I can flip it for a profit! That bimbo said I could always refinance before the rates went up! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More emphasis on the size of the sensor, less on the megapixel count.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Coding Horror: Spartan programming</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001148.html&quot;&gt;Spartan programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discipline of spartan programming means frugal use of variables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize number of variables. Inline variables which are used only once. Take advantage of foreach loops.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize visibility of variables and other identifiers. Define variables at the smallest possible scope.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize accessibility of variables. Prefer the greater encapsulation of private variables.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize variability of variables. Strive to make variables final in Java and const in C++. Use annotations or restrictions whenever possible.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize lifetime of variables. Prefer ephemeral variables to longer lived ones. Avoid persistent variables such as files.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize names of variables. Short-lived, tightly scoped variables can use concise, terse names.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimize use of array variables. Replace them with collections provided by your standard libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Benefits of writing unit tests first</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;Benefits of writing unit tests first&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests prove that your code actually works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get a low-level regression-test suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can improve the design without breaking it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's more fun to code with them than without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They demonstrate concrete progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests are a form of sample code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It forces you to plan before you code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reduces the cost of bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's even better than code inspections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It virtually eliminates coder's block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests make better designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's faster than writing code without tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers, interpreters, compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing actions in a variety of target languages.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google Documents List Data API allows client applications to upload documents to Google Documents and list them in the form of Google Data API (&quot;GData&quot;) feeds. Your client application can request a list of a user's documents, and query the content in an existing document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things you can do with the Documents List Data API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Upload the word processing documents and spreadsheets on your computer to allow you to back them up or collaborate online when editing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find all of your documents that contain specific keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get a list of spreadsheets which can be accessed through the Google Spreadsheets Data API.&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Vijay Santhanam code: IDisposable wrapper and ReaderWriterSlimLock</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vijay.screamingpens.com/&quot;&gt;Vijay Santhanam&lt;/a&gt; has a small blog with quality material that I really like. There are a couple of bits of code that I want to use in my own applications and frameworks, so I am writing them out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vijay.screamingpens.com/archive/2008/05/26/actiondisposable.aspx&quot;&gt;ActionDisposable&lt;/a&gt;, code to wrap IDisposable around any object
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-cs&quot;&gt;using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace System
{
    public class ActionDisposable: IDisposable
    {
        Action action;
        public ActionDisposable(Action action)
        {
            this.action = action;
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            action();
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Similar code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://vijay.screamingpens.com/archive/2008/08/08/readerwriterlockslim-extension-methods.aspx&quot;&gt;wrap IDisposable around ReaderWriterLockSlim&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-cs&quot;&gt;namespace System.Threading
{
    public static class ReaderWriteLockExtensions
    {
        struct Disposable : IDisposable
        {
            readonly Action action;
            public Disposable(Action action)
            {
                this.action = action;
            }

            public void Dispose()
            {
                action();
            }
        }

        public static IDisposable ReadLock(this ReaderWriterLockSlim l)
        {
            l.EnterReadLock();
            return new Disposable(l.ExitReadLock);
        }

        public static IDisposable UpgradableReadLock(this ReaderWriterLockSlim l)
        {
            l.EnterUpgradeableReadLock();
            return new Disposable(l.ExitUpgradeableReadLock);
        }

        public static IDisposable WriteLock(this ReaderWriterLockSlim l)
        {
            l.EnterWriteLock();
            return new Disposable(l.ExitWriteLock);
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sample code for using the IDisposable ReaderWriterSlimLock:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-cs&quot;&gt;
    var rwLock = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();
    using (rwLock.ReadLock())
    {
        // do reading stuff
    }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Sudoku patterns</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few good sites for learning sudoku patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scanraid.com/Sudoku.htm&quot;&gt;ScanRaid&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many patterns described in text, including very advanced methods. Has a solver that applies techniques in succession so that you can see a particular technique applied to an actual puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/techniques.htm&quot;&gt;Sadman software&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-12-05: If I could just start to recognize these patterns, I'd be on my way to becoming a decent sudoku solver:&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack&quot;&gt;HTML Agility Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an agile HTML parser that builds a read/write DOM and supports plain XPATH or XSLT (you actually don't HAVE to understand XPATH nor XSLT to use it, don't worry...). It is a .NET code library that allows you to parse &quot;out of the web&quot; HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with &quot;real world&quot; malformed HTML. The object model is very similar to what proposes System.Xml, but for HTML documents (or streams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Page fixing or generation&lt;p&gt;You can fix a page the way you want, modify the DOM, add nodes, copy nodes, well... you name it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Web scanners&lt;p&gt;You can easily get to img/src or a/hrefs with a bunch XPATH queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Web scrapers&lt;p&gt;You can easily scrap any existing web page into an RSS feed for example, with just an XSLT file serving as the binding. An example of this is provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucene is an Information Retrieval System used for full-text searching and scoring results commonly referred to as a search engine (similar to google-type-searching). LINQ is Microsoft's extensible Language Integrated Query platform that provides querying directly in a managed CLR. LINQ comes out of the box with LINQ to Objects, LINQ to DataSets, LINQ to XML, LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities. The goal of LINQ to Lucene is to provide developers with the ability to enjoy full-text searching using a fast-proven search-engine within the .Net managed CLR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>The Atlantic: The Market as God</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99mar/marketgod.htm&quot;&gt;The Market as God: Living in the new dispensation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the apex of any theological system, of course, is its doctrine of God. In the new theology this celestial pinnacle is occupied by The Market, which I capitalize to signify both the mystery that enshrouds it and the reverence it inspires in business folk. Different faiths have, of course, different views of the divine attributes. In Christianity, God has sometimes been defined as omnipotent (possessing all power), omniscient (having all knowledge), and omnipresent (existing everywhere). Most Christian theologies, it is true, hedge a bit. They teach that these qualities of the divinity are indeed there, but are hidden from human eyes both by human sin and by the transcendence of the divine itself. In &quot;light inaccessible&quot; they are, as the old hymn puts it, &quot;hid from our eyes.&quot; Likewise, although The Market, we are assured, possesses these divine attributes, they are not always completely evident to mortals but must be trusted and affirmed by faith. &quot;Further along,&quot; as another old gospel song says, &quot;we'll understand why.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who want to understand the mechanism [of classic debt-deflation bust at work] might ponder Irving Fisher's comment in 1933: When it comes to booms gone bust, &quot;over-investment and over-speculation are often important; but they would have far less serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-September, however, the outlook was much grimmer. On Monday, September 15th, Lehman Brothers, another Wall Street investment bank that had made bad bets on subprime mortgage securities, filed for bankruptcy protection, after Bernanke, Paulson, and the bank's senior executives failed to find a way to save it or to sell it to a healthier firm. During the next forty-eight hours, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly four hundred points; Bank of America announced its purchase of Merrill Lynch; and American International Group, the country's biggest insurance company, began talks with the New York Fed about a possible rescue. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the two wealthiest investment banks on Wall Street, were also in trouble. Their stock prices tumbled as rumors circulated that they were having difficulty borrowing money. &quot;Both Goldman and Morgan were having a run on the bank,&quot; a senior Wall Street executive told me. &quot;People started withdrawing their balances. Counterparties started insisting that they post more collateral.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Flixxy has a great trailer for an animated film, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flixxy.com/coraline-movie-preview.htm&quot;&gt;Coraline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) is bored in her new home until she finds a secret door and discovers an alternate version of her life on the other side. On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life and the people in it - only much better. But when this seemingly perfect world turns dangerous, and her other parents try to trap her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination and bravery to escape this increasingly perilous world - and save her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Twenty Reasons Why We're Not Consuming</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nouriel Roubini (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/&quot;&gt;blog: Roubini Global Economonitor&lt;/a&gt;) has a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/2008/11/19/consumer-debt-savings-oped-cx_nr_1120roubini.html?partner=daily_newsletter&quot;&gt;article in Forbes online&lt;/a&gt; on why the recession is not going away anytime soon. The short answer: No savings and a pile of debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&lt;p&gt;This week's news about October retail sales (-2.8% relative to the previous month and now down in real terms for five months in a row) confirm that the U.S. has entered its most severe consumer-led recession in decades. At this rate of free fall in consumption, real gross domestic product growth could be a whopping 5% negative or even worse in the fourth quarter of 2008. And this is not a temporary phenomenon: Almost all of the fundamentals driving consumption are heading south on a persistent and structural basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>107 years of DOW data</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're going to have friends ask you questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has there ever been a period that the market has been down 5% or more in three consecutive months? or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is this the worst 91-day period in the past 107 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you are going to need some DOW data. And it had better be pretty long range to cover the Great Depression and other stock market excitement of the early 20th century. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.analyzeindices.com/dowhistory/djia-100.txt&quot;&gt;This text file&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good for simple purposes. Mind you, it covers only up to fall of 2007, but it's pretty easy to get this additional data from Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I did not know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The market was closed from late August 1914 through to December.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The market as open only four days a week in 1968 or 1969 so that back office could catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to make some decisions of how you will handle these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Trading signal: bounce off resistance</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the market was heading lower as it has done for the balance of the week. Then, at 13:00, everything started to move up. I checked the news sources and could find nothing that explained it. I emailed a friend and got this answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technician would say, buyers appeared at the previous low below 8000. Successful test. Didn't fall apart so they bought it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should watch the DOW (or ETF DIA). I've just watched SPY and QQQQ. It didn't occur to me that the entire market could move off resistance to a DOW level. And look at how sweet it is that it hit RSI 30 at the low. Just perfect for an oversold rally to start.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Portfolio.com: The End</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis, author of &lt;em&gt;Liar's Poker&lt;/em&gt;, writes on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom?#page=0&quot;&gt;the end of the era&lt;/a&gt; that defined Wall Street. Lots of opinion on subprime mortgages and CDOs and Wall Street, no finger-pointing at Alan Greenspan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I was writing a period piece about the 1980s in America. Not for a moment did I suspect that the financial 1980s would last two full decades longer or that the difference in degree between Wall Street and ordinary life would swell into a difference in kind. I expected readers of the future to be outraged that back in 1986, the C.E.O. of Salomon Brothers, John Gutfreund, was paid $3.1 million; I expected them to gape in horror when I reported that one of our traders, Howie Rubin, had moved to Merrill Lynch, where he lost $250 million; I assumed they'd be shocked to learn that a Wall Street C.E.O. had only the vaguest idea of the risks his traders were running. What I didn't expect was that any future reader would look on my experience and say, &quot;How quaint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no great agenda, apart from telling what I took to be a remarkable tale, but if you got a few drinks in me and then asked what effect I thought my book would have on the world, I might have said something like, &quot;I hope that college students trying to figure out what to do with their lives will read it and decide that it's silly to phony it up and abandon their passions to become financiers.&quot; I hoped that some bright kid at, say, Ohio State University who really wanted to be an oceanographer would read my book, spurn the offer from Morgan Stanley, and set out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow that message failed to come across. Six months after &lt;em&gt;Liar's Poker&lt;/em&gt; was published, I was knee-deep in letters from students at Ohio State who wanted to know if I had any other secrets to share about Wall Street. They'd read my book as a how-to manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing, looking back on it, is how long it took for even someone who predicted the disaster to grasp its root causes. They were learning about this on the fly, shorting the bonds and then trying to figure out what they had done. Eisman knew subprime lenders could be scumbags. What he underestimated was the total unabashed complicity of the upper class of American capitalism. For instance, he knew that the big Wall Street investment banks took huge piles of loans that in and of themselves might be rated BBB, threw them into a trust, carved the trust into tranches, and wound up with 60 percent of the new total being rated AAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he couldn't figure out exactly how the rating agencies justified turning BBB loans into AAA-rated bonds. &quot;I didn't understand how they were turning all this garbage into gold,&quot; he says. He brought some of the bond people from Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and UBS over for a visit. &quot;We always asked the same question,&quot; says Eisman. &quot;Where are the rating agencies in all of this? And I'd always get the same reaction. It was a smirk.&quot; He called Standard &amp; Poor's and asked what would happen to default rates if real estate prices fell. The man at S&amp;P couldn't say; its model for home prices had no ability to accept a negative number. &quot;They were just assuming home prices would keep going up,&quot; Eisman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Ernie Chan and quantitative trading</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across the book 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Trading-Build-Algorithmic-Business/dp/0470284889&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantitative Trading: How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on quantitative trading at Barnes and Noble tonight. It looks interesting but I have enough of a backlog that I would not get around to it soon. However, he also has an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://epchan.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt; that covers some of the same interesting material as in his book. I'll add that to my list of blogs to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage/89/04702848/0470284889.jpg&quot; /&gt;The business of algorithmic trading was an activity once reserved for only traders at hedge funds or the proprietary trading operations of financial institutions. Not so anymore says author Ernie Chan, a proprietary trader and blogger who runs a &lt;a href=&quot;http://epchan.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;quantitative trading blog site&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Quantitative Trading&lt;/em&gt;, Chan shows investors how to use Excel and MATLAB(r) to build their own algorithmic trading tools using a budget even a home day trader can afford. He then reveals how to conduct quantitative research and analysis, and discusses what it takes to turn quantitative trading strategies into profits using stocks, ETFs, and other financial instruments. Chan also provides downloadable spreadsheets and MATLAB programs that tie into material covered throughout this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;Paris itinerary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom had an ambitious itinerary for her two week trip to Paris this fall. Check this out if you are planning a trip to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Museums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Museum&quot;&gt;Mus&amp;eacute;e de Cluny&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mus&amp;eacute;e de Cluny houses a variety of important medieval artifacts:

	&lt;li&gt;Works of gold, ivory, antique furnishings, and illuminated manuscripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conciergerie&quot;&gt;Conciergerie&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conciergerie is a former royal palace and prison in Paris, located on the west of the &amp;Icirc;le de la Cit&amp;eacute;, near the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. It is part of the larger complex known as the Palais de Justice, which is still used for judicial purposes. Hundreds of prisoners during the French Revolution were executed on the guillotines at La Conciergerie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_de_Victor_Hugo&quot;&gt;Victor Hugo's house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmottan&quot;&gt;Mus&amp;eacute;e Marmottan Monet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mus&amp;eacute;e Marmottan Monet features a collection of a hundred Impressionist works by Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas, &amp;Eacute;douard Manet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as the Wildenstein Collection of illuminated manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast Carnavalet Museum, devoted to the history of Paris, includes entire decorated rooms with panelling, furniture and many works of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mus&amp;eacute;e Rodin displays works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_Picasso&quot;&gt;Mus&amp;eacute;e Picasso&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mus&amp;eacute;e Picasso contains more than 3000 different works of art by Pablo Picasso including drawings, ceramics and paintings. This is complemented by Picasso's own personal art collection of works by other artists, including C&amp;eacute;zanne, Degas, Rousseau, Seurat, de Chirico and Matisse. It also contains some Iberian bronzes and a good collection of primitive art. One of the most impressive aspects of the museum is that it contains a large number of works which Picasso painted after his seventieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Department stores&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;P&amp;egrave;re Lachaise is one of the most famous cemeteries in the world. Located in the 20th arrondissement, it is reputed to be the world's most-visited cemetery, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors annually to the graves of those who have enhanced French life over the past 200 years. It is also the site of three World War I memorials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>GM trading strategy: short on open, cover on close</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. All you had to do with GM for the past couple of months was to short at the open and cover at the close. You'd have made 30% in September, 208% in October, and 33% so far in November. And GM is down from $5.00 at the open to $4.22 today. That's an extra 15%. If you didn't wait for the close, you'd be up 53% this month. On one trade per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you'd have to have really believed in this trade to have carried it out for all of September. There was a 25% drawdown until the 19th of September followed by +69% until the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Der Spiegel: What Happens when Countries Go Bankrupt?</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,588419,00.html&quot;&gt;What Happens when Countries Go Bankrupt?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungary, Ukraine, and Pakistan lead a list of countries headed for bankruptcy. Here's what it looks like when a country goes under:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs of looming national bankruptcy are plentiful, and bankers in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo know them well. In late 2001, they were the first to see the coming crash in Argentina. Men traveled across the Rio de la Plata, from Buenos Aires to Montevideo, carrying suitcases filled with US dollars. They stood in long lines at the city's banks, depositing the contents of their suitcases into accounts and safe deposit boxes there. Uruguay is South America's Switzerland, a safe haven for money in times of crisis. No one asks about where the millions come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Argentine businessmen had transferred their dollars abroad, the second phase of the collapse began. The Argentine government froze all bank accounts, capping the maximum amount an accountholder could withdraw at only $250 (&amp;#8364;198) a week. Small investors, those who had left their money in the banks, were the hardest hit. Tens of thousands of desperate citizens stormed the banks, and many spent nights sleeping in front of the automated teller machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last phase of the downturn began in the Buenos Aires suburbs. After consumption had dropped by 60 percent, young men began looting supermarkets. In December 2001, 40,000 people gathered on Plaza de Mayo in front of the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace. There, they banged pots and pans together day and night, until an unnerved President Fernando de la R&amp;#250;a fled by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of the fleeing president has burned itself into the collective memory of Argentineans. It marks the worst financial crisis of the last 100 years. De la R&amp;#250;a's successor allowed the peso to float free on the world currency-exchange markets after it had been pegged to the US dollar at a ratio of 1:1. Tens of thousands of small business owners, who had incurred debt when the peso was still pegged to the dollar, filed for bankruptcy. Unemployment quickly ballooned to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>WSJ: Five Myths About the Great Depression</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB122576077569495545-lMyQjAxMDI4MjA1NDcwNjQwWj.html?mod=igoogle_wsj_gadgv1&quot;&gt;Five Myths About the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert Hoover was no proponent of laissez-faire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herbert Hoover, elected president in 1928, was a doctrinaire, laissez-faire, look-the-other way Republican who clung to the idea that markets were basically self-correcting.&lt;/em&gt; The truth is more illuminating. Far from a free-market idealist, Hoover was an ardent believer in government intervention to support incomes and employment. This is critical to understanding the origins of the Great Depression. Franklin Roosevelt didn't reverse course upon moving into the White House in 1933; he went further down the path that Hoover had blazed over the previous four years. That was the path to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

                <title>Great years for wines</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you find out which year is best for a particular region? I've found that California wines from 2002 and 2004 are really great, but I have no information or insight into other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Lori and I recently opened an Australian table wine that turned out to be quite good. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/Excelsior/2006/USA-/USD/A/-/0&quot;&gt;Black Swan Shiraz 2006&lt;/a&gt;. I'd be interested in knowing if there was a really good year for this wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, on election night, we had a South African wine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/Excelsior/2006/USA-/USD/A/-/0&quot;&gt;Excelsior Cabernet-Sauvignon 2006&lt;/a&gt;. Also unknown to me what would be a great year for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, both of these wines are about $6-7 per bottle, making them great choices for regular drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-11-06: My sister-in-law suggested the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine_Picks/0,3657,,00.html&quot;&gt;Wine Spectator daily picks&lt;/a&gt;, and each of the wines I mentioned, albeit in a different year, has been featured in Wine Spectator as an Under $15 Daily Pick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine/0,1142,4664,00.html&quot;&gt;BLACK SWAN Shiraz-Cabernet&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;South Eastern Australia 2005 (85 points, $8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily_Wine/0,1142,1470,00.html&quot;&gt;EXCELSIOR  Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Robertson 2002 (87 points, $8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Which states are divided by time zone?</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geography.about.com/library/faq/blqzstatesbrokenbytimezones.htm&quot;&gt;Which states are divided by time zone?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the election, there was some concern that news media were listing a single time for the polls to close in states that have two time zones, making it possible that people might arrive at the polls too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most states lie within a single time zones, there are thirteen states that are divided into two time zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idaho and Oregon are split between the Mountain and Pacific time zones. Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas are divided between Central and Mountain time zones. Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee are split between Eastern and Central time zones. Finally, Alaska is divided between the Alaska time zone and the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>CodeProject: A simple QuadTree implementation in C#</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/QuadTree.aspx&quot;&gt;A simple QuadTree implementation in C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A QuadTree is a spatial partitioning strategy used to make queries on relationships between 2D spatial data such as coordinates in a Geographic Information System (GIS), or the location of objects in a video game. For instance, you may need to know all of the objects within a region on a map, test weather objects are visible by a camera, or optimize a collision detection algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The QuadTree is so named because it recursively partitions regions into four parts, with leaf nodes containing references to the spatial objects. Querying the QuadTree is a function of traversing the tree nodes that intersect the query area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OctTree is the analogous structure used for 3 dimensional problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One volatility measure, shown in the accompanying charts, is the number of days in which an index closes up or down at least 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In normal times, the market goes years without having even one such day. There were none, for instance, from 2003 through 2007. There were three such days throughout the 1950s and two in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, there were nine such days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/goldman-sees-no-limits-on-leverage-analyst-says/&quot;&gt;Goldman Sees No Limits on Leverage, Analyst Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Times story on how Goldman Sachs is not planning to change its use of leverage, notwithstanding that it is now a &quot;bank holding company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may have morphed into a bank holding company, but the Wall Street firm doesn't feel compelled to lower its leverage or pull back in any of its business lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the key point that Roger A. Freeman, Barclays Capital's banking analyst, says he took away from his meeting with Gary Cohn, Goldman's president and chief operating officer, and David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Goldman executives told Mr. Freeman that the firm's &quot;business model is sound and not likely to be upended as a result of the new bank holding company structure and Federal Reserve oversight,&quot; Mr. Freeman said, paraphrasing their comments in a research note published Thursday. More specifically, Goldman's executives told Mr. Freeman that the firm &quot;does not expect to see any imposition of leverage ratio thresholds or business mix restrictions.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;Support and Resistance: The Greatest Trading Tool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good article on trading in general and on support and resistance specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the hype from the internet marketers who try to sell you the latest trading 'secrets', the fact is there are NO secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify setups which provide the potential for lower risk and/or higher probability trades. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enter and manage those trades in a consistent and disciplined manner. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Minimize risk. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Manage your money. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Manage your emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Journal your results, and review them to identify what's working and what's not working. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep doing what is working, and &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improve what is not working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not trading successfully, it's because you're not doing one (or perhaps all) of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Movable Type 4.21 publication slow</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Complete-2008-10-30.png&quot;&gt;not my idea of good performance&lt;/a&gt;. This is 1400 entries. It used to take about 10-20 minutes. What's going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-10-30: Here is &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Entry-2008-10-30(2).png&quot;&gt;just the entries&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, 144 minutes for the 1400 entries in this weblog. That's 10 per minute. I thought Movable Type 4.21 was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/the-top-5-things-you-can-do-to-make-movable-type-even-faster.html&quot;&gt;supposed to be faster&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-10-31: In an effort to assist my website host, webhosting4life.com,  in isolating the problem&lt; I republished my website this afternoon. It took a really long time: &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Complete-2008-10-31.png&quot;&gt;251 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've provided a number of ideas for them to explore:
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the queries are all causing table scans. I've looked at the phpmyadmin system variables for MySQL and they are consistent with large numbers of table scans due to missing keys in searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no activity was found on my database, then perhaps the MySQL activity is from another user. These MySQL settings are both database and global settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slow_queries&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Handler_read_rnd&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Handler_read_rnd_next&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select_full_join&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select_range_check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these values are exceptional and all suggest queries that are not properly hitting indexes, causing table scans. Again, I recommend looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/slow-query-log.html&quot;&gt;slow queries log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, 10% of the queries to the database my website uses have taken more than &lt;em&gt;long_query_time&lt;/em&gt; seconds. That seems a really high ratio.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                <title>Movable Type 4.21: publication time comes to a standstill</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I upgraded to 4.21 from 4.1 in the past day. I have tried to republish my weblog with a new style, but the republish times are horrific (1400 entries across 4 years):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;??? seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Entry.png&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; (ran for about 80 minutes before stalling on the completion screen)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2353 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/AuthorMonthly.png&quot;&gt;author monthly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1335 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/CategoryMonthly.png&quot;&gt;category monthly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;843 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Monthly.png&quot;&gt;monthly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;161 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Category.png&quot;&gt;category archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;73 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/IndexTemplates.png&quot;&gt;index templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;16 seconds for &lt;a href=&quot;/images/MovableType/Page.png&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's 80 minutes without entries. For comparison, it used to take only 15 to 20 minutes to republish the entire site before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked at the phpmyadmin system variables for MySQL and they are consistent with large numbers of slow queries, probably caused by table scans due to missing indexes in searches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slow_queries has crept up from 526k to 574k slow queries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Handler_read_rnd from 4641k to 5341k&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Handler_read_rnd_next from 955M to 1116M&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select_full_join from 9373 to 10k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my weblog is hosted (on Windows under IIS6, no less) and I don't have access to any raw MySQL logs. I can't run MySQL from a command prompt. I have no way of telling which queries are causing the slow down. Also, I cannot upgrade the perl version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas for discovering the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;instrument the perl code to record SQL queries &amp; time to execute&lt;br /&gt;
...except I don't know what perl code executes the SQL queries. Plus, the code goes directly to the DBI/DBD perl module to execute SQL. It would mean patching the code in a zillion places.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add indexes to MT tables in MySQL&lt;br /&gt;
But indexes on which columns of which tables?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add foreign keys to MT tables in MySQL&lt;br /&gt;
Again: where?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with an idea is welcome to leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fairfieldwestchester.net/Meetings/Fairfield---Westchester-Code-Camp.aspx&quot;&gt;Fairfield / Westchester Code Camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday November 8th, 2008, the Fairfield / Westchester developer community will be holding our second Fairfield / Westchester Code Camp! The event will be hosted by The University of Connecticut School of Business, at the Stamford Campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuing goal of the Code Camps series is to provide an intensive developer-to-developer learning experience that is fun and technically stimulating. The primary focus is on delivering programming information and sample code that can be put to practical use. The event is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be there!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Upgrade to Movable Type 4.21</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably a big mistake. I can't see any published pages anymore. If you are reading this, though, then I've solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up installing a lot of Perl packages to get things working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;version&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Text::Balance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IO::Compress::Zlib&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IO::Compress::Base&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compress::Raw::Zlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The compression ones were in the forlorn hope that I would be able to get backups with compression working. No joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Now publishing my website (say, after a style change) takes &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Special guest content: Jeff Linderman</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, Jeff Linderman, asked me to post this so that there is a record of his prediction. The text is taken from an email submission he made to two major financial publications. When he gets his own blog, he'll post the content there. Until then, you heard it here first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary: Jeff Linderman, underground financial pundit to the few and vastly unknown to the many, highlights the link between systemic leverage and misleading aggregate economic growth over the past five years. His conclusion? A modern-day Depression cannot be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/jeff-linderman-predicts-depres.html&quot;&gt;Jeff Linderman: economic downturn could become a depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-11-12: Jeff Linderman now has his own weblog on blogspot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://economicvesuvius.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Economic Vesuvius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By semi-popular demand, this is a compendium of musings on our current and future social/financial/economic state of affairs...with input from family/friends/colleagues. Its purpose is to fill a void in mainstream media coverage which, by definition, appeals to the masses and is generally devoid of critical or semi-controversial analysis. Expect to see discussions of financial topics in anything from equity markets to commodities to FX; economic topics such as retail sales and personal consumption/industrial production; and social/cultural behavioral phenomena as it relates to our present and upcoming quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-11-13: Jeff Linderman beats Soros to the punch: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE4AC5IN20081113&quot;&gt;Soros says deep recession inevitable, depression possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;!-- C# in Depth --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/skeet/&quot;&gt;C# in Depth&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In programming, there's no substitute for knowing your stuff. In versions 2 and 3, C# introduces new concepts such as lambda expressions and implicit typing that make the language more flexible and give you more power. Using Language INtegrated Query (LINQ)--also new in C# 3--you can interact with data of any type directly from C#. Simply put, mastering these features will make you a more valuable C# developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# in Depth is designed to bring you to a new level of programming skill. It dives deeply into key C# topics--in particular the new ones. You'll learn to reuse algorithms in a type-safe way with C# 2 generics and expand the functionality of existing classes and interfaces using C# 3 extension methods. Tricky issues become clear in author Jon Skeet's crisp, easy-to-follow explanations and snappy, pragmatic examples. With this book under your belt, you will easily learn--and then master--new frameworks and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- .NET for Financial Markets --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Financial-Markets-Experts-Voice/dp/1590595645/&quot;&gt;.NET for Financial Markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- Pro .NET 2.0 Windows Forms and Custom Controls in C# --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/NET-Windows-Forms-Custom-Controls/dp/1590594398/&quot;&gt;Pro .NET 2.0 Windows Forms and Custom Controls in C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/2008-NET-Platform-Fourth-Windows-Net/dp/1590598849/&quot;&gt;Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- Concurrent Programming on Windows --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Concurrent-Programming-Windows-Microsoft-Development/dp/032143482X&quot;&gt;Concurrent Programming on Windows&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duffy aims to give application, system, and library developers the tools and techniques needed to write efficient, safe code for multicore processors. This is important not only for the kinds of problems where concurrency is inherent and easily exploitableâsuch as server applications, compute-intensive image manipulation, financial analysis, simulations, and AI algorithmsâbut also for problems that can be speeded up using parallelism but require more effortâsuch as math libraries, sort routines, report generation, XML manipulation, and stream processing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concurrent Programming on Windows&lt;/em&gt; has four major sections: The first introduces concurrency at a high level, followed by a section that focuses on the fundamental platform features, inner workings, and API details. Next, there is a section that describes common patterns, best practices, algorithms, and data structures that emerge while writing concurrent software. The final section covers many of the common system-wide architectural and process concerns of concurrent programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- .NET Multithreading --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/dennis/&quot;&gt;.NET Multithreading&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need high performance, or a rich user experience, you should consider multithreading. With .NET you can develop stable and robust multithreaded applications with minimal effort. .NET Multithreading teaches the basics in an understandable and practical way. It then focuses on .NET's mechanisms for multithreading and shows how easy it can be to develop applications with them. The book covers several design approaches such as one-thread-one-class, the asynchronous design pattern, and using queues as buffers between threads. It explains best practices and how to avoid common multithreading pitfalls such as deadlock and race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is written for intermediate .NET developers who know C# or VB .NET, but are not assumed to have a background in multithreading. It is rich in examples that will help you understand the subject and produce multithreaded applications that have the power of C++ while keeping the ease and reliability of .NET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- NHibernate in Action --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/kuate/&quot;&gt;NHibernate in Action&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic &quot;Hello World&quot; example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- IronPython in Action --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/foord/&quot;&gt;IronPython in Action&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and 'duck typing', metaprogramming, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- LINQ in Action --&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/marguerie/&quot;&gt;LINQ in Action&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;LINQ, Language INtegrated Query, is a new extension to the Visual Basic and C# programming languages designed to simplify data queries and database interaction. It addreses O/R mapping issues by making query operations like SQL statements part of the programming language. Adding to its power, LINQ is extensible and can be used to query various data sources. It offers built-in support for querying in-memory collections like arrays or lists, XML, DataSets, and relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LINQ in Action is a fast-paced, comprehensive tutorial for professional developers who want to use LINQ. This book explores what can be done with LINQ, shows you how it works in an application, and addresses the emerging best practices. It presents the general purpose query facilities offered by LINQ in the upcoming C# 3.0 and VB.NET 9.0 languages. A running example introduces basic LINQ concepts. You'll then learn to query unstructured data using LINQ to XML and relational data with LINQ to SQL. Finally, you'll see how to extend LINQ for custom applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LINQ in Action will guide you along as you navigate this new world of lambda expressions, query operators, and expression trees. You'll also explore the new features of C# 3.0, VB.NET 9.0. The book is very practical, anchoring each new idea with running code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!-- Effective REST Services --&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://safari.oreilly.com/9780321612366&quot;&gt;Effective REST Services via .NET: For .NET Framework 3.5&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective REST Services via .NET begins by discussing contemporary technologies and laying the groundwork for why REST services are so exciting and useful. It describes how they work and how both client and server-based code can access data using REST services. It details the URL, which is fundamental to accessing REST services. It then provides examples of the use of REST services in both desktop-based and Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book delves into how to create REST services using existing .NET technologies, including ASP.NET (coupled with IIS 7.0), services hosted by the new ASP.NET model-view-controller (MVC) architecture,  services hosted by the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). The book finishes with coverage on exciting new technologies such as cloud computing (codename AZURE) and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer to a question from StackOverflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the best practices to do transactions in C# .Net 2.0. What are the classes that should be used? What are the pitfalls to look out for etc. All that commit and rollback stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeguru.com/columns/vb/article.php/c11067&quot;&gt;The TransactionScope Object Makes ADO.NET Transactions Easy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article shows you how easy it is to use transactions with previous versions of .NET, and how you can use the TransactionScope object to auto-enlist database operations in a transaction. Other kinds of things, such as COM+ objects, can participate in transactions as well, but this article focuses on ADO.NET transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPI.NET is a high-performance, easy-to-use implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/&quot;&gt;Message Passing Interface&lt;/a&gt; (MPI) for Microsoft's .NET environment. MPI is the de facto standard for writing parallel programs running on a distributed memory system, such as a compute cluster, and is widely implemented. Most MPI implementations provide support for writing MPI programs in C, C++, and Fortran. MPI.NET provides support for all of the .NET languages (especially C#), and includes significant extensions (such as automatic serialization of objects) that make it far easier to build parallel programs that run on clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Cramer at the height of the bubble</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is Jim Cramer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html&quot;&gt;pumping a bunch of tech stocks on 2000-02-29&lt;/a&gt;, just weeks before the NASDAQ topped. Here is a quote to take you back to those days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the Dow, made up principally of companies that can't raise the bar, is down 12% while the Nasdaq, which is made up of companies that can raise the bar, is up 12%. And in the self-fulfilling jungle that is Wall Street, only growth can maintain growth!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&amp;s=SVNX%2bARBA%2bISLD%2bEXDS%2bINSP%2bINKT%2bMERQ%2bSNRA%2bVRSN%2bVRTS&quot;&gt;where are they now&lt;/a&gt;? Three still trade on the NASDAQ, two are on the pink sheets, and five don't trade with these symbols -- probably out of business. ARBA trades for about 1% of its bubble-high of $1500, INSP is at 0.5% of its high of over $1500, and VRSN trades for about 10% of its high of $300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&amp;s=MRK%2bPFE%2bX%2bPD%2bUNP&quot;&gt;Old Economy stocks he singles out to diss&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phelps_Dodge&quot;&gt;Freeport-McMoRan acquired Phelps Dodge&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 for $25.9 billion in cash and stock, so I'm just going to guess that that's a positive return. Just by eyeballing the other charts, I'd say that these are the returns over the same period:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MRK -50%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PFE -75%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;X +150%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;UNP +200%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, I think you'd have to be ahead with the Old Economy picks that Cramer sneered at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term paper biz is managed by brokers who take financial risks by accepting credit card payments and psychological risks by actually talking to the clients. Most of the customers just aren't very bright. One of my brokers would even mark assignments with the code words DUMB CLIENT.  That meant to use simple English; nothing's worse than a client calling back to ask a broker -- most of whom had no particular academic training -- what certain words in the paper meant. One time a client actually asked to talk to me personally and lamented that he just didn't &quot;know a lot about Plah-toe.&quot; Distance learning meant that he'd never heard anyone say the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Market trades huge range with volume</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So I thought, &quot;Wow, the Nasdaq 100 traded a huge range today.&quot; I looked at the stats for the past two years and realized that every day in October, the trading range (high to low as a percentage of the low) has been one of the top 25 values in that period. In fact, every value is in the top 20. If you look at the trading volume for that time, 8 of the 12 trading days in October rank in the top 25. It's amazing how volatile the market is compared to its historical averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/QQQQ (range and volume).xls&quot;&gt;Excel spreadsheet of QQQQ range and volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-11-01: I updated the spreadsheet to include all of the data in October. Of the 25 days in the past two years with the widest trading range, 19 were in October. The first of October was ranked 117th and the thirtieth of October was ranked 47th, but no other day in October was outside the top 30 days in the past 516 trading days.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Better Than Buy-And-Hold</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/14/stops-limits-trading-pf-ii-in_cl_1014soapbox_inl.html?partner=daily_newsletter&quot;&gt;Better Than Buy-And-Hold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy-and-hold is not only the riskiest possible strategy, it doesn't even qualify to be called a strategy. Buy-and-hold is actually the absence of any intelligent exit strategy and is mostly adopted by default. Buy-and-hold is only recommended by unknowing pundits who are out of touch with the modern marketplace and are willing to advise their followers that taking unlimited risk and being in the market 100% of the time is a good idea. Obviously, that mistaken advice has proved to be very costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three suggestions on how to implement an effective trailing exit strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify the direction of the current trend. If the trend is up you will want to set the trailing exit a safe distance away from prices so that you do not exit while the stock is trending up. You want to let profits run. If the trend is down, set the exit closer to prices to cut losses and preserve capital.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on volatility and adjust the exits farther away if volatility increases and then move them closer if volatility decreases. The exits need to be kept outside of normal up-and-down price action that changes with volatility. Volatility is presently at record levels so give the upward trending stocks plenty of room.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before you exit, make sure you have a plan to re-enter the stock if the uptrend resumes. The trailing exit provides a very valuable yet inexpensive form of loss insurance. The price of that insurance is that your exit may occasionally get you out at a point where the stock stops going down and turns up. Rather than miss the uptrend and blame the protective exit for the lost opportunity, simply buy the shares back. Worst case, you will have paid a small price for protection from a possibly catastrophic loss. Your exit did its job. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;My response&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have never used Perl and my unix skills are not deep (I

scheduler). I match up on the other skills, though. Give me a call to
discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

                <title>The TED spread</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/09/understanding_t.html&quot;&gt;Understanding the TED spread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote  class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One measure that is being used to summarize the strain in financial markets is the TED spread. This is calculated as the gap between 3-month LIBOR (an average of interest rates offered in the London interbank market for 3-month dollar-denominated loans) and the 3-month Treasury bill rate. The size of this gap presumably reflects some sort of risk or liquidity premium. I was interested to break the TED spread down into identifiable components to try to get a better understanding of what may be responsible for its recent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can break the TED spread down into separate components using the following accounting identity. Let LIBOR3 denote the 3-month LIBOR rate, LIBOR0 the overnight rate, TARGET the fed funds target, and TBILL the 3-month Treasury bill rate. The TED spread is defined as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;TED = (LIBOR3 - TBILL)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which can be rewritten as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;(LIBOR3 - TBILL) = (LIBOR3 - LIBOR0) + 
    (LIBOR0 - TARGET) + 
    (TARGET - TBILL)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beyondthesoundbite.blogspot.com/2008/10/vinny-catalano-on-npr.html&quot;&gt;NPR on the TED spread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TED spread is at the epicenter of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metafilter.com/75629/Dont-watch-the-Dow-Here%E2%80%99s-the-number-that-really-captures-the-financial-crisis-TED-spread&quot;&gt;Metafilter 2008-10-14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg rates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=US0003M%3AIND&quot;&gt;Bloomberg 3-month LIBOR quote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=.TEDSP:IND&quot;&gt;Bloomberg TED spread quote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the TED spread to see the state of the crisis. You're looking for lower numbers, preferably below 50 to 100 basis points.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.06&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;yfifrstchld&quot;&gt;5 Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.94&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;even&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;yfifrstchld&quot;&gt;10 Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.84&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;yfifrstchld&quot;&gt;30 Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.27&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;4.12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2008-10-14: The 3-month yield was only 12 basis points. This is phenomenally low, indicating a great deal of fear in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be keeping my money out of the market until the TED spread returns to a more normal rate, like 50 to 100 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap. Ok, it's Procmon time. Who owns this dialog box? I give the dialog a good shake while Task Manager is open. That's a low-tech way of answering the Who's Process Is This question - grab a dialog with the mouse and shake it around the screen...the process that owns it will start using a little bit of CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin: Imagine that I let you borrow $50, but in exchange for my generosity, you promise to pay me back the $50 with an extra $10 in interest. To make sure you pay me back, I take your Charizard Pokemon card as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia: Kevin, I don't play Pokemon anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin: I'm getting to that. Let's say that the Charizard is worth $50, so in case you decide to not return my money, at least I'll have something that's worth what I loaned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin: But one day, people realize that Pokemon is stupid and everyone decides that the cards are overvalued. That's right--everybody turned twelve on the same day! Now your Charizard is only worth, say, $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>DbLinq Project: Linq Provider for MySql, Oracle and PostgreSQL</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.code2code.net/DB_Linq/index.html&quot;&gt;DbLinq Project: Linq Provider for MySql, Oracle and PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is an O/R (Object-Relational) mapping tool, with some similarities to  Hibernate or LlblGen.  LINQ is type-safe, queries get compiled into MSIL on the fly, and your C# WHERE clauses are translated into SQL and sent to SQL server for execution. In short, it makes design of data access layers safer and faster. In C# 3.0, linq code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-cs&quot;&gt;var q = from p in db.Products
         where p.ProductName == &quot;Pen&quot;
         select p.ProductID;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really looking forward to trying out a Linq-capable driver for MySQL. Then I'll be able to use LinqPad [&lt;a href=&quot;http://linqpad.net/&quot;&gt;LinqPad.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/08/linqpad.html&quot;&gt;internal link&lt;/a&gt;] on my database.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Parallel performance in .NET</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163329.aspx&quot;&gt;Running Queries On Multi-Core Processors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLINQ is a query execution engine that accepts any LINQ-to-Objects or LINQ-to-XML query and automatically utilizes multiple processors or cores for execution when they are available. The change in programming model is tiny, meaning you don't need to be a concurrency guru to use it. In fact, threads and locks won't even come up unless you really want to dive under the hood to understand how it all works. PLINQ is a key component of Parallel FX, the next generation of concurrency support in the Microsoft &amp;174; .NET Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using technologies like PLINQ will become increasingly crucial to ensuring the scalability of software on future parallel microprocessor architectures. By utilizing LINQ at choice places throughout your applications today--such as where you have data- or compute-intensive operations that can be expressed as queries--you will ensure that those fragments of your programs continue to perform better when PLINQ becomes available and the machines running your application grow from 2 to 4 to 32 processors and beyond. And even if you only run that code on a single-processor machine, the overhead of PLINQ is typically so small that you won't notice a difference. In addition, the data parallel nature of PLINQ ensures your programs will continue to scale as the size of your data sets increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163340.aspx&quot;&gt;Optimize Managed Code For Multi-Core Machines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is designed to make it much easier to write managed code that can automatically use multiple processors. Using the library, you can conveniently express potential parallelism in existing sequential code, where the exposed parallel tasks will be run concurrently on all available processors. Usually this results in significant speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPL is being created as a collaborative effort by Microsoft &amp;174; Research, the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) team, and the Parallel Computing Platform team. TPL is a major component of the Parallel FX library, the next generation of concurrency support for the Microsoft .NET Framework. Though it has not yet reached version 1.0, the first Parallel FX Community Tech Preview (CTP) will be available from MSDN &amp;174; in Fall '07. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar&quot;&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar&lt;/a&gt; for details. TPL does not require any language extensions and works with the .NET Framework 3.5 and higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Chesapeake CEO Sold All Stock to Meet Margin Call</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ac.ZepgPjAfI&amp;refer=home&quot;&gt;Chesapeake CEO Sold All Stock to Meet Margin Call&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Chesapeake Energy Corp. said its chief executive officer, Aubrey McClendon, involuntarily sold ``substantially all'' of his common shares of the company's stock over the past three days to meet margin loan calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;These involuntary and unexpected sales were precipitated by the extraordinary circumstances of the worldwide financial crisis,'' McClendon said in today's statement. &quot;In no way do these sales reflect my view of the company's financial position or my view of Chesapeake's future performance potential.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McClendon, 49, owned 33.5 million shares, or 5.8 percent of the company's common stock, according to a Sept. 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He was the company's third-largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One word: wow.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Holding at 1%</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the technical indicators I track is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$NYA50R&amp;p=D&amp;yr=3&amp;mn=0&amp;dy=0&amp;id=p67065509431&quot;&gt;percentage of NYSE stocks trading above their 50-day moving average&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, when this indicator hits 10-15%, it's the bottom of the bear rally, and usually the top is at 75-80%. Currently, this indicator has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$NYA50R&amp;p=D&amp;st=2007-10-10&amp;en=2008-10-10&amp;id=p07081575242&quot;&gt;holding steady at 1%&lt;/a&gt; for the past two days, the lowest number I've ever seen. And yet, I don't see a reason to believe we've seen the bottom yet.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Steven Rambam, a private investigator, maintains that the combination of self-contributed data and the mechanisms of business have brought about the explosion in public availability of personal data. Or as he puts it, &quot;If you know how to use the Internet, 75% of an investigation can be conducted sitting in your pajamas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper River, a well-known fund that focuses on short selling, lost more than 50% in September, while Tontine Partners, run by Jeffrey Gendell, fell by almost 60%, according to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tontine&quot;&gt;tontine&lt;/a&gt;, you ask? It's&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;an annuity scheme in which subscribers share a common fund with the benefit of survivorship, the survivors' shares being increased as the subscribers die, until the whole goes to the last survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jada was Lori's favorite vineyard and my second favorite. Their specialty is a Rhone Valley wine: lots of syrah, mourvedre, and grenache. The Hell's Kitchen is fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saucelitocanyon.com/wines.fsp?id=127966&quot;&gt;Zinfandel 2006, Arroyo Grande Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wine.appellationamerica.com/vineyard/Piedra_Creek_Winery.html&quot;&gt;Piedra Creek&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Piedra Creek visit comes with a story. We had not intended to go there, but started to take recommendations from other vineyards, based on the description we provided of what we liked. The people at Saucelito Canyon recommended we call Piedra Creek for a tasting. We drove over and sat on their house's back porch where Margaret poured us samples. The atmosphere was very personal and pleasant. The owners have been making wine for 25 years and been married for 56, if I recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zin Santo is very sweet -- more of a dessert wine because of an accident in the sugar level. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;San Floriano 2006&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Zin Santo 2005&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are visiting San Luis Obispo, you have to eat at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novorestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Novo Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. The food and wines are spectacular. The outdoor patio is set under broad trees on a deck beside a creek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-11-07: almost forgot a special purchase we made. We bought a case of Panza claret 2004 (sold out) from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quixotewinery.com/&quot;&gt;Quixote Winery&lt;/a&gt; in Napa.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Stock picks</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Strictly on technicals, I am picking these stocks for long and short positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short: ALJ, CTAS, RSH, APOL, STT, ATHR, CHH, DISH, CVS, BAX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long: REP, JOSB, PXD, ARTC, BVN, ACAS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pairs: REP/PXD, ALJ; ACAS, STT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: STT is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2008/34-58592.pdf&quot;&gt;SEC list of protected short stocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy has not been backtested and I make no assurances of performance. You use these recommendations purely at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any sane person would want to have been on the opposite side of almost every one of those trades. The longs were consistently way off and the shorts would have lost money, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short positions&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Snap shots</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snap.com/snapshots.php&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in someone else's website: any link on your page that you hover over pops up a snapshot image of the page. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I needed to add it to my own Movable Type website. As near as I can tell, it just requires adding some JavaScript to the Footer template.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Sector snapshot: cool New York Times market graphic</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2006/04/02/business/20060402_SECTOR_GRAPHIC.htm&quot;&gt;graphic of sector performance&lt;/a&gt; from the New York Times. Mind you, as my buddy Jeff says, &quot;How is this going to make you money?&quot; I have to admit I don't have a certain way in the market, but I think it is a good high level filter for finding stuff to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

options &amp;amp; swaptions, FRAs and caps / floors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team 
Overview:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Fixed Income CRE team develops trade-specific plugins 
in C++ to calculate Risk and P&amp;amp;L. The system covers all vanilla, inflation 
and exotic products traded within the Fixed Income desk globally. It is also 
being deployed for other business lines such as Emerging Markets. It is a global 
team with a presence in London, New York and Tokyo - and there will be 
significant interaction with the other regions. First-line application support 
is done by a global Application Management team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Function &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;C++ development 
within the CRE plugins framework. This will be to introduce functionality 
throughout all the trade types supporting a new curve methodology. This is a 
strategic piece of development which will deliver a comprehensive pricing and 
risk benefit to the Fixed Income traders. There will be global management of the 
project and development performed in multiple centers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 new core 
plugins to be coded in C++ - and each existing trade plugin will need extension 
to subscribe to the new curve framework. There will be a significant period of 
user testing and interaction with the traders to ensure the new functionality is 
performing to specification. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Duties&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daily work 
on the C++ plugin code-base to deliver the new functionality. Disciplined code 
management and liaison with the rest of the global team on merging. Running and 
authoring new unit test cases to ensure new functionality works correctly while 
maintaining existing behaviour. In User Acceptance Testing - work with the 
traders to ensure signoff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A good 
degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or similar discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5+ years of C++ development experience, 
preferably with Microsoft Visual C++. Investment bank exposure within a 
derivatives area. Knowledge of interest rate derivative products, curve 
construction, risk and P&amp;amp;L explain methodologies would be extremely 
beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills and knowledge: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential skills: Strong C++, XML, 
Perforce or other source control. Preferred skills: VBA, IR derivatives 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidate profile:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Proven ability to work within a 
team environment. Clear and fluent use of English - and good written/verbal 
communication. Excellent problem solving skills - and the ability to exercise 
independent judgement. We require a self-starter, who has the ability to quickly 
adapt to our complex RiskEngine framework. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                <title>My first StackOverflow question</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been asked a few times about appdomains. I know the basics in a theoretical way, but I was unclear on the actual application. I asked my first question at StackOverflow, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97433/good-example-of-use-of-appdomain&quot;&gt;Good example of use of AppDomain&lt;/a&gt;, to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2008-09-20: &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/04/03/61190.aspx&quot;&gt;What is an application domain - an explanation for .Net beginners&lt;/a&gt; appears to be the basis for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appdomain&quot;&gt;wikipedia article on appdomains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Charlie and Lola.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
I recently got these two videos from the &lt;em&gt;Charlie and Lola&lt;/em&gt; series for my six year old niece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Lola-Vol-Actually-Party/dp/B000XA5K02/&quot;&gt;Charlie &amp; Lola, Vol 7 - This Is Actually My Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw it on TV first and thought it was nice. The cartoons have pleasing drawing. The plot and characters are enjoyable. I thought it was pretty cute. Hope she likes them!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How Magazines Led Investors Toward Ruin</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bad news for investors who take &lt;a href=&quot;http://gawker.com/5050946/how-magazines-led-investors-toward-ruin&quot;&gt;stock tips from Fortune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In December, Fortune magazine admitted it had been remiss naming insurance giant AIG one of its &quot;10 Stocks To Buy Now&quot; before a yearlong 18 percent decline. &quot;We... didn't expect [the] mortgage unit to be such an albatross,&quot; editors wrote. To correct the error, the magazine had a fresh list of &quot;The Best Stocks For 2008&quot; -- including Merrill Lynch. &quot;Smart investors should buy this stock before everyone else comes to their senses,&quot; Fortune wrote, calling a recent correction in Merrill stock &quot;an overreaction.&quot; Investors who followed this advice are now down 93 percent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Hidden features of C#</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a really &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9033/hidden-features-of-c&quot;&gt;good post at StackOverflow.com&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Features of C#&lt;/em&gt; that asks, &quot;[W]hat are the most hidden features or tricks of c# that even c# fans, addicts, experts barely know?&quot; And lots of the answers provided were unknown to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some favorite points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/concurrency/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Parallel Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform (PCP) team [...] enables the shift to modern, multi- and manycore hardware, by providing a runtime that provides core support for parallelism and resource management, programming models, libraries, and tools that make it easy for developers to construct correct, efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel programs.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/linqbridge.html&quot;&gt;LINQBridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;With Studio's multi-targeting and LINQBridge, you'll be able to write local (LINQ to Objects) queries using the full power of the C# 3.0 compiler--and yet your programs will require only Framework 2.0.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Needs More Cowbell</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone came up with a website that allows you to upload MP3s and to add cowbell and Christopher Walken (as SNL character Bruce Dickinson) to the track. Some favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morecowbell.dj/listen?id=Cu0r2E&quot;&gt;Devo - Whip It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morecowbell.dj/listen?id=cU6wq&quot;&gt;Joe Jackson - Is She Really Going Out With Him?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morecowbell.dj/listen?id=FjlMC&quot;&gt;The Beatles - A Hard Day's Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morecowbell.dj/listen?id=DixsPk&quot;&gt;Queen and Bowie - Under Pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morecowbell.dj/listen?id=ZFIxY&quot;&gt;George Harrison - While My Guitar Gently Weeps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Someone is wrong on the internet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife thinks &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/386/&quot;&gt;this cartoon&lt;/a&gt; summarizes her life. It just might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to cut back but sometimes it's irresistible. I don't send stuff on &quot;that begs the question&quot; when people really means it raises the question anymore. Life is just too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, at her prompting, I did write to the NYT writer about his use of the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigal_son&quot;&gt;&quot;prodigal son&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/us/06poe.html&quot;&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So far, no one has taken up Mr. Pettit's call for Philadelphia's best grave robbers to bring home the city's prodigal son before the bicentennial of Poe's birth in January 2009.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parable of the prodigal son is about a son who prematurely claims his inheritance and spends it all wastefully. That's what makes him prodigal: his wastefulness of a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You label Poe a prodigal son because you think the parable is about leaving or leaving and returning rather than the wastefulness. Poe was perhaps wasteful of his talent or his money, but that is not the central part of your argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt that will set everyone straight and we can move on.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Banning trackback spammers</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently I started moving IP addresses found in Movable Type's &lt;em&gt;mt_tbping&lt;/em&gt; table to &lt;em&gt;mt_ipbanlist&lt;/em&gt;, with the view to turning the trackback spammers invisible. As I understand it, IP addresses found in &lt;em&gt;mt_ipbanlist&lt;/em&gt; are sent away with a 403 error or otherwise do not show up in the traffic log. I found a list of banned IP addresses online and added them to my &lt;em&gt;mt_ipbanlist&lt;/em&gt; table. Now I have over 26 000 banned IP addresses and yet I still get about 5 spammy trackbacks per day. How many spammers are out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/files/mt-ipbanlist.txt&quot;&gt;Banned IP list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>SWIG: Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swig.org/&quot;&gt;SWIG&lt;/a&gt; is an important software tool for integrating external libraries into applications. Previously mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2006/08/mashalling-in-c-and-swig.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI), Java, Lua, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave and R. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG may be freely used, distributed, and modified for commercial and non-commercial use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Air Traffic Safety vs. Capacity</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gettheflick.blogspot.com/2008/01/air-traffic-safety-vs-capacity.html&quot;&gt;Air Traffic Safety vs. Capacity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any runway has a finite capacity. The key to understanding this is in understanding time. Only one aircraft is allowed to use the runway at any time. It takes a certain amount of time for a departing aircraft to taxi onto a runway, accelerate to flying speed and lift off. Likewise, it takes a certain amount of time for an arriving aircraft to touch down, slow down and taxi off the runway. The time it takes the typical airliner to do either one -- land or takeoff -- is roughly one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math is as simple as it is inescapable. Roughly 60 airliners can use a runway in one hour if conditions are absolutely perfect. It is physically impossible to improve that number. However, it can get a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stasi, the state police of East Germany, kept extensive files on citiizens, totalling an estimated 1 billion pages. When the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi agents shredded and hand-tore the documents for months. Not all of the documents were disposed of, though, and now the hand-torn pages are being digitally reassembled using paper scanners and computer programs to logically stitch the pages together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Manish Sharma&lt;br /&gt;
10:40 Position we were looking at (C#/Java) is on hold -- not hiring in this economy. No positions suitable. Offered to help me with job search. I am calling him back in the afternoon to discuss strategy/approach.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beth Akin&lt;br /&gt;
9:30 Left message for her to call.&lt;br /&gt;
10:15 Sent list of current Credit Suisse positions that would be good.&lt;br /&gt;
13:50 Called Beth, didn't connect. She got my email and is looking into the opportunities I listed.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Eric Ross&lt;br /&gt;
10:50 Called Eric Ross. No C# positions, most .NET hiring is in hedge funds. Slow, bare bones hiring, end of summer.&lt;br /&gt;
His recommendations: contact past managers and consider looking outside finance.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;John Keenan (Continuity Partners)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at his website and saw two positions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C# / .Net developer&lt;br /&gt;
open since 2007-08-20&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Software Engineer&lt;br /&gt;
Job Code: #1014&lt;br /&gt;
Title: C++ - Intermediate - Credit Risk - 52574&lt;br /&gt;
Date Posted: 08/20/2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called him at 14:00 and I asked about the second position. It's at Morgan Stanley using unix. We talked about whether is is worthwhile for me to get into unix. He thinks not -- employers are going to be selective now and not willing to take lower ability. He thinks I am going to get hired in Visual C++ or .NET/C#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asked if I was being represented at Credit Suisse and Barclay's because he figures they do the most .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recommended that I look at a job search engine called indeed.com because it is an aggregator that has contract work. He thinks that looking for contract work is more likely than fulltime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job search sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Daily WTF&lt;br /&gt;
Only open position is with BridgeWater. I've interviewed there and they were not really receptive.&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>NYC apartment for rent, available 01 Sep 2008</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has a studio that is available for rent stating September first. Here is her description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My former apartment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=west+81st+at+Columbus,+New+York,+NY&amp;sll=40.787512,-73.977363&amp;sspn=0.011064,0.019312&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.787317,-73.975153&amp;spn=0.011064,0.019312&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=40.783081,-73.974107&amp;panoid=qrSKOq-5RmvXpV6v5wNXUQ&quot;&gt;West 81st Street at Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; (prime Thanksgiving balloon-viewing real estate, as many of you know) is available for rent as of September 1.  It's a large (550 square feet) sunny studio with high ceilings, a fabulous location, and great park views.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you or anyone you know might be interested -- act fast, as it will be given to a broker to rent by the end of next week if no one contacts me before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: doorman building, elevator, laundry facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact me through this blog to express interest.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>World Ultimate and Guts Championship 2008 in Vancouver</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been following the ultimate frisbee championships in Vancouver off and on over the internet. Partly I was interested because I play frisbee, partly because a friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbase.com/cmberghout/image/101408904&quot;&gt;Arnold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbase.com/cmberghout/image/101408919&quot;&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, was playing for the USA Masters team, and partly because it was in Canada. The level of play looked pretty high, but it quickly became obvious that the teams from Canada, USA, Japan, and Australia were the ones to beat. They dominated in all divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final results:&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Banning the spammers</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I am getting really tired of the trackback spam. I was looking around in my MySQL administrator and found the tables that Movable Type uses to track tentative trackbacks (mt_tbping) and banned IP addresses (mt_ipbanlist). I wrote up a little SQL to copy IP addresses from unapproved trackback locations to the banned list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;INSERT INTO mt_ipbanlist
(ipbanlist_blog_id, ipbanlist_ip)
SELECT MY_BLOG_ID, tbping_ip
FROM mt_tbping
WHERE tbping_ip &lt;&gt; 'MY_HOST_IP_ADDRESS'
AND tbping_ip NOT IN (
	SELECT ipbanlist_ip 
	FROM mt_ipbanlist
	WHERE ipbanlist_blog_id = MY_BLOG_ID)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'll have to check that all unapproved trackbacks are spam first, but I am hoping that the volume drops in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2008-08-13: added &lt;a href=&quot;/files/mt-ipbanlist.txt&quot;&gt;my list of banned IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;, trackback spammers one and all.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Lots of traffic today</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So today I got more hits than in all of May 2008. It's really not clear where the traffic is going (since I don't have access to the raw logs) nor where it came from. I can say that the IP addresses are from everywhere: India, Japan, Australia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, France, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Hungary, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Spain, Finland, Israel, Guam, South Africa, Jamaica, and Romania. You know -- everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'll figure it out in awhile. IWeb will show up in google as linked to something interesting that will explain it, like slashdot or something.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Bingo cards</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, finding custom bingo card generators on the internet is the kind of pseudo-technical challenge I occasionally get roped into. My sister-in-law is getting married, so my wife needed some sort of bingo cards for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelorette_party&quot;&gt;bachelorette party&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not asking what that's all about. Anyway, I didn't want to write software for this, so finding it on the internet was my best choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of amazingly bad choices out there, but the most common failing is the creation of cards where the text is only one text line high per row. Sheesh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly the best: &lt;a href=&quot;http://print-bingo.com/bingo-cards-custom.php&quot;&gt;print-bingo.com&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configurable free square (free or not; text in free square)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size of text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cards per page of paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size of bingo card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configurable word list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;words appear in designated column only or any column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;column headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great bachelorette party, Lisa!&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/linqpad(2).gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linqpad.net/&quot;&gt;LinqPad&lt;/a&gt; is a subsystem interpreter for LINQ in the same vein as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regular expression tools&lt;br /&gt;
like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#regexd&quot;&gt;RegexDesigner.NET&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm&quot;&gt;Expresso&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radsoftware.com.au/regexdesigner/&quot;&gt;RegexDesigner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/&quot;&gt;C# snippet compiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#CsvFileTester&quot;&gt;ADO.NET CSV file tester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/#FormatDesigner&quot;&gt;.NET Format Designer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows you to test out all the LINQ features in .NET 3.5 against any data source of your choosing, plus it provides lots of test cases and sample data sources. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/LINQ-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/0596519249/&quot;&gt;LINQ Pocket Reference&lt;/a&gt; to go with this.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Amazing Ultimate Frisbee catch</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are two videos of a catch made by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://manhattanultimate.com/Summer2008/index.htm&quot;&gt;summer league&lt;/a&gt; teammate of mine when he played in the Ultimate Frisbee finals in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how he had to follow the arc of this throw while outrunning his coverage the whole time. It's amazing. I can watch these videos over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Iron Python sites</title>
                <description>&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/&quot;&gt;Iron Python in Action (Manning Publications book)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trypython.org/&quot;&gt;Try Python in the Browser: an IronPython and Silverlight 2 Interactive Interpreter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ironpython.info/&quot;&gt;IronPython Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wiki contains recipes and example code for IronPython. IronPython is a Microsoft port of the Python Programming Language to the .NET framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Contents&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Useful Links&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Downloads&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IronPython in Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a dynamic language, used for a wide variety of purposes, with an emphasis on clean and expressive code. It allows the maximum flexibility for the developer, whilst maintaining readability of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IronPython brings Python to .NET, and allows you native access to the .NET framework and classes. It runs on Microsoft .NET and on Mono, a cross-platform Open Source implementation of the .NET runtime and framework libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Separated shoulder</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I injured my shoulder playing in my Ultimate Frisbee league. I took a bad tumble on the field and landed on my shoulder, tearing the ligaments that join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Pectoral_girdle_front_diagram.svg&quot;&gt;clavicle and the scapula&lt;/a&gt;. The technical name is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_joint&quot;&gt;acromioclavicular joint&lt;/a&gt; or a-c joint for short. The complete diagnosis is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/images/1230552-1261906-2058.jpg&quot;&gt;grade III separation of the acromioclavicular joint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not especially painful but the recovery time is fairly high (one to three months). Recovery is mostly passively immobilizing the shoulder in a sling and later physiotherapy to regain strength and range of motion. I'm looking for good sources of shoulder exercises, like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article.asp?section=845&quot;&gt;ShoulderDoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uptodateonline.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~8Xm8h.pwl70pNy&quot;&gt;UptoDateOnline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it comes with a permanent outcome: there's going to be a bump on my left shoulder for good.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Dev102.com programming challenge #13</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Dev102.com poses this programming challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your input is a string which is composed from bracket characters. The allowed characters are:'(', ')', '['. ']', '{', '}', '&lt;' and '&gt;'. Your mission is to determine whether the brackets structure is legal or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of a legal expression: &quot;([](&lt;{}&gt;))&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of an illegal expression: &quot;({&lt;)&gt;}&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide the most efficient, elegant and simple solution for that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's pretty obvious to me that you push opening brackets on the stack and pop off closing brackets, ensuring that the correct closing bracket is encountered. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;def Evaluate(str):
  stack = []
  pushChars, popChars = &quot;&lt;({[&quot;, &quot;&gt;)}]&quot;
  for c in str :
    if c in pushChars :
      stack.append(c)
    elif c in popChars :
      if not len(stack) :
        return False
      else :
        stackTop = stack.pop()
        balancingBracket = pushChars[popChars.index(c)]
        if stackTop != balancingBracket :
          return False
    else :
      return False
  return not len(stack)&lt;/pre&gt;

You supply a phrase and it generates an MD5-based table of hash segments. You provide a password and it generates a strong password from the table. I take this to mean that you can have strong passwords for multiple websites by 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;remembering a single phrase and &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;supplying the names of websites you intend to use them on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary tests I've done with strong password checkers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/checker.mspx&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securitystats.com/tools/password.php&quot;&gt;SecurityStats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php&quot;&gt;Rumkins.com&lt;/a&gt;) indicate that the resulting passwords are highly rated.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm embarrassed to say that &lt;a href=&quot;http://armorgames.com/play/1760/hedgehog-launch&quot;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt; is actually fun to play. The premise: a country's space program is going to be based on launching hedgehogs (optionally equipped with jetpacks, parachutes, and radar) into the air using rubber bands and launchpads.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://danga.com/memcached/&quot;&gt;MemCached&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/memcacheddotnet/&quot;&gt;.NET memcached client library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;C#/.NET memcached client library. This library can be used by .NET projects to access memcached servers. Ported from the Java memcached library located at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whalin.com/memcached/&quot;&gt;http://www.whalin.com/memcached/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>The Princess Bride</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The Princess Bride is a favorite film of mine. Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; links plus the most well-known dialogue from the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right... and who is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: You've made your decision then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: Wait til I get going! Now, where was I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: Yes, Australia. And you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: You're just stalling now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied, and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal, so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: You're trying to trick me into giving away something. It won't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: IT HAS WORKED! YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING AWAY! I KNOW WHERE THE POISON IS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: Then make your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: I will, and I choose - What in the world can that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: [Vizzini gestures up and away from the table. Roberts looks. Vizzini swaps the goblets]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: What? Where? I don't see anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: Well, I- I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.First, let's drink. Me from my glass, and you from yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black, Vizzini: [they drink]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: You guessed wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well-known is this: never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizzini: [Vizzini stops suddenly, and falls dead to the right]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buttercup: And to think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in Black: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Jet ski: power and safety</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea of how many horsepower a typical jet ski has? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetski.com/article.cfm?id=529&quot;&gt;On this page&lt;/a&gt;, it appears to be 110 to 155 hp, topping out at about 215 hp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that matter, I did not know about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/opin/jetskis.html&quot;&gt;safety problem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998 the National Transportation Safety Board criticized the basic design of all personal watercraft: &quot;Personal watercraft have no braking mechanism. They coast to a stop, and while coasting, there is no turning ability.&quot; Tom Ebro, president of Aquatic Risk Management in Florida, concurs. &quot;What makes personal watercraft so ultra-dangerous is the fact that it will not steer when you suddenly have a surprise and let off the throttle.&quot; Unlike traditional boats &quot;jet skis' are rudderless. And when the throttle is off, a speeding jet ski is like a car on ice. It can't stop. It can't turn, and the driver has no control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineer-inventor Charles Willis explains the difference between safe, traditional boats and personal watercraft. &quot;Boats have propellers, something down in the water, and the drag slows down the boat when the motor is off. The hull creates water resistance and so motorboats stop much faster than jet skis. PWCs are very different than boats. There is nothing underneath the hull. There's no drag. The product has a big flaw: it can't stop.&quot; A Yamaha diagram puts &lt;strong&gt;stopping distance between 260 to 470 feet&lt;/strong&gt;. The owner's manual for Willis' Kawasaki Ultra-150 says: &quot;Leave 348 feet to come to a stop.&quot; That's longer than a football field -- without steering, without control. [Emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to remember to give them a very wide margin in the future when I'm driving a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>A control on the other hand is a component that provides a UI. To do this you need to implement System.Windows.Forms.Control OR System.Web.UI.Control. So a control is basically a component that has visual properties.

component is a class that implements the System.ComponentModel.IComponent interface or derives from a class that does

You need a place to hold your components and controls. This is done in a Container. A Container is a class that implements the System.ComponentModel.IContainer interface

                <title>Dev102.com programming challenge #10</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/net/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-10/&quot;&gt;Programming challenge #10&lt;/a&gt; has been posted at dev102.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all the numbers 1..n were present, then they would sum to &lt;b&gt;n(n+1)/2&lt;/b&gt;.
If some x is absent, then they will sum to &lt;b&gt;n(n+1)/2 - x&lt;/b&gt;. So to determine which number is missing, subtract the sum of the series from the expected sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This python code finds the missing number in the series named values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;def test(values) :
	max_val = len(values) + 1
	expected_sum = max_val*(max_val + 1) / 2
	return expected_sum - sum(values)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a complete test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;import random
def test(values) :
	max_val = len(values) + 1
	expected_sum = max_val*(max_val + 1) / 2
	return expected_sum - sum(values)

test_range = 200
for i in range(1,test_range) :
	a = range(1, i) + range(i+1, test_range+1)
	random.shuffle(a)
	x = test(a)
	if x != i :
		print &quot;Failed at &quot;, i
		print a
		print sum(a)
		break&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>US State Quarters Update 3</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/coins/STWI_small.jpg&quot; /&gt;I traded for two Denver coins: 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/120px-2004_MI_Proof.png&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/119px-2004_WI_Proof.png&quot;&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've updated &lt;a href=&quot;../../2008/05/us-state-quarters.html&quot;&gt;my list of missing Denver mint coins&lt;/a&gt; to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Dev102.com programming challenge #9</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/net/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-9/&quot;&gt;Programming challenge #9&lt;/a&gt; has been posted at dev102.com. I think that this is about the shortest solution possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially did this recursively, but I needed two functions: one for the base case using the root and one for all other cases. Here, I just set up the preconditions in variables outside the loop and iterate over the left and right nodes. Which node is second last depends upon whether we went left or right in the last iteration: if left, then the current; if right, then the parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;Node secondLast(Node root)
{
 boolean wentRight = true;
 Node parent = NULL, current = root;
 while (current-&gt;left &amp;&amp; current-&gt;right)
 {
  parent = current;
  wentRight = (current-&gt;right != NULL);
  current = wentRight ? current-&gt;right : current-&gt;left;
 }
 return (wentRight ? parent : current);
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I could be perverse and write the loop with a body of a single line, assigning to parent, wentRight, and current within a single ternary operator statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
  current = (wentRight = ((parent = current)-&gt;right != NULL)) ?
   current-&gt;right : current-&gt;left;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's a bit obscure just for the sake of brevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2008-06-24: I could even drop the &lt;i&gt;wentRight&lt;/i&gt; variable and use the &lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt; variable to record which way we went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
 while (current-&gt;left &amp;&amp; current-&gt;right)
 {
  parent = (current-&gt;right != NULL) ? current : NULL;
  current = (parent == NULL) ? current-&gt;right : current-&gt;left;
 }
 return (parent != NULL) ? parent : current;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're down to a loop with just two variables. I don't think I can make the code shorter and simpler than that.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not entirely on the mark. Some of these sites maintain real open source projects. Others, like CodeProject, are write-only sites with no collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/&quot;&gt;CodePlex&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

CodePlex is Microsoft's open source project hosting web site.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

SourceForge.net is the world's largest Open Source software development web site. SourceForge.net provides free hosting to Open Source software development projects with a centralized resource for managing projects, issues, communications, and code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshmeat.net/&quot;&gt;FreshMeat&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

freshmeat maintains the Web's largest index of Unix and cross-platform software, themes and related &quot;eye-candy&quot;, and Palm OS software. Thousands of applications, which are preferably released under an open source license, are meticulously cataloged in the freshmeat database, and links to new applications are added daily. Each entry provides a description of the software, links to download it and to obtain more information, and a history of the project's releases, so readers can keep up-to-date on the latest developments.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeproject.com/&quot;&gt;CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

The Code Project was formed to provide developers with a place to meet and exchange ideas. We hope to provide developers with all the resources they need to help them in their day to day programming, as well as helping them keep up to date with the latest technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Electoral college meets dynamic programming</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.swtch.com/2008/06/electoral-programming.html&quot;&gt;great programming article&lt;/a&gt; on how to calculate the combinations of states to produce 270 or more electoral college votes. I've honestly never done any dynamic programming problems like this. At least, I haven't done them the dynamic programming way; I've done them by brute force, and often I haven't gotten an answer because brute force is too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I'll be revisiting some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; problems because with this method and insight, so many more problems will be tractable. In particular, I expect &lt;a href=&quot;http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=152&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; will succumb to a dynamic programming solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here is the python code to solve the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;votes = [55, 34, 31, 27, 21, 21, 20, 17, 15, 15,
    15, 13, 12, 11, 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10,
    10,  9,  9,  9,  8,  8,  7,  7,  7,  7,
     6,  6,  6,  5,  5,  5,  5,  5,  4,  4,
     4,  4,  4,  3,  3,  3,  3,  3,  3,  3,
     3,
]
import collections
ways = collections.defaultdict(int)
ways[0] = 1
for n in xrange(len(votes)) :
    for v in xrange(270+votes[n]-1, votes[n]-1, -1) :
        ways[v] += ways[v-votes[n]]
print sum(ways[k] for k in ways.iterkeys() if k &gt;= 270)&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>CodeFetch</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codefetch.com/&quot;&gt;CodeFetch&lt;/a&gt;] allows developers to search programming books online for code samples in the language of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you wanted to find a C# code sample that implements a priority queue, like &lt;a href=&quot;../../2008/05/programming-challange-find-top.html&quot;&gt;I did here&lt;/a&gt;. You could get several implementations from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codefetch.com/search?qy=priorityqueue&amp;lang=csharp&quot;&gt;CodeFetch&lt;/a&gt; with a simple search. Mind you, the implementations I'm seeing are a bit bizarre. Would you really implement a priority queue by maintaining a sorted array?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there just one user who keeps on getting his IP reassigned? Are all the machines in this provider hopelessly compromised? What could account for so many machines coming from swbell.net?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas prices are high throughout the country, but how hard they hit individual families depends on income levels, which vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Open Source Shakespeare</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/shakespeare-sepia.jpg&quot; /&gt;
I was doing a crossword puzzle this afternoon and needed some Shakespeare quotes to complete the clues. (Sometimes, I can't get the answer from the clue alone. I need help.) So I googled for a specific Shakespeare play, act, and scene, and it came up with 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&quot;&gt;Open Source Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;. 
It's amazing! It has all the plays, all the sonnets, and a concordance. What more could you ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I interviewed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluemountaincapital.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;BlueMountain Capital Management&lt;/a&gt;. Not my worst interview ever, but I was really out of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Design a library lending system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are weak references?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is a hashtable? Can any object be a key? Can any object be a value? Can a mutable object be the key?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in C#?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Calculate the recovery rate for a CDS at par with one period remaining.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Implement a deep copy routine for an object that may have cycles or self-reference.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Write a routine to calculate the minimum depth of a leaf node in a binary tree.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is the complexity of a hashtable search? What is the complexity in the degenerate case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with Steve, Axel, and Perry Vais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source Analysis, also known as StyleCop, analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of best practice style and consistency rules. It can be run from inside of Visual Studio or integrated into an MSBuild project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft FxCop 1.36&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FxCop is a code analysis tool that checks .NET managed code assemblies for conformance to the Microsoft .NET Framework Design Guidelines. It uses MSIL parsing, and callgraph analysis to inspect assemblies for more than 200 defects in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Library design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Globalization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Naming conventions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Interoperability and portability&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Jeff Richter on the CLR Asynchronous Programming Model</title>
                <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc546608.aspx&quot;&gt;Simplified APM with the AsyncEnumerator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here Jeffrey Richter introduces his AsyncEnumerator class, which drives an iterator so that different thread pool threads can execute the same code at different times.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163323.aspx&quot;&gt;Simplified APM with C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jeffrey Richter introduces his AsyncEnumerator class and explains how it harnesses some recent additions to the C# programming language that make working with the asynchronous programming model significantly easier.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163415.aspx&quot;&gt;Asynchronous Device Operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff Richter uses the AsyncResult&lt;TResult&gt; class to implement the CLR's Asynchronous Programming Model to perform hardware device operations asynchronously.&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Miniature Enigma Machines from Bletchley Park</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Miniature Enigma machines (from Bletchley Park): for the ubergeek in your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/pocket_enigma.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/view_product.rhtm/133066/238505/detail.html&quot;&gt;Pocket Enigma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Designed exclusively for and only available through Bletchley Park, Pocket Enigma is a little cipher machine with a single wheel that rotates on the CD mount in a compact disk case.  It works on exactly the same principles as the real Enigma machine used by the German armed forces during WW II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!-- I can't believe I did this. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/enigma_e.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/view_product.rhtm/133066/238531/detail.html&quot;&gt;Enigma-E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Enables you to build your very own battery powered Electronic Enigma machine, based on those used by Bletchley Park codebreakers during WWII. DIY simulation of the 8 wheel M3 and M4 Enigma. All components are included. Features an alpha-numerical display, lamp panel and 26 key keyboard as well as separate Stecker board. Requires only basic soldering experience, although basic knowledge of electronics may be required to understand the circuit description.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Dev 102 bit twiddling challenge</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Dev102 had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/05/05/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-2/&quot;&gt;bit twiddling programming challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a 1000X1000 grayscale image where each pixel is 8 bits, you need to reverse the order of the bits in each pixel. Example: 10001101 becomes 10110001, 00111101 becomes 10111100 and so on. Provide the most efficient solution in the manner of performance because another input is that you need to handle many images per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge amounts to providing code that transforms every byte in a bitmap so that its bits were reversed -- bits 1 and 8 exchange, bits 2 and 7 exchange, bits 3 and 6 exchange, and bits 4 and 5 exchange. The obvious answer is to create a lookup table because an individual byte will always map onto a particular reversed byte. You may as well do the calculation only once and then just use the byte value as a lookup into the table of reversed bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that part is obvious and not very interesting. How to reverse the bits though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/05/12/a-programming-job-interview-challenge-3/&quot;&gt;lots of good answers&lt;/a&gt; (and I really like &lt;a href=&quot;http://igoro.com/archive/programming-job-interview-challenge/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) but none uses my approach. I took each pair of bits to be exchanged and observed that there can be four possible outcomes: 00, 01, 10, and 11. If they come out 00 or 11, you don't have to do anything: they are already reversed. If they are 01 or 10, then you need to map them to 10 or 01, respectively. And you can get that by XOR-ing the result with the mask that produced the two bit combination. That is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;AND the byte with an appropriate mask&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;if the result has one bit set of the two,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;XOR the masked result with the mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;def reflected(x) :
    result = 0
    masks = (0x81, 0x42, 0x24, 0x18)
    outcomes = ((0x80, 0x01), (0x40, 0x02), 
        (0x20, 0x04), (0x10, 0x08))
    for mask, outcome in zip(masks, outcomes) :
        y = x &amp; mask
        if y in outcome :
            y ^= mask
        result |= y
    return result&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;/files/bit_twiddling.py.txt&quot;&gt;Python source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/coins/STPA_small.jpg&quot; /&gt;
A big coin collecting day: I found Denver mint quarters for 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/STWY_small.jpg&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/STMT_small.jpg&quot;&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/STPA_small.jpg&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/STMO_small.jpg&quot;&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/STKS_small.jpg&quot;&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;! Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've updated &lt;a href=&quot;../../2008/05/us-state-quarters.html&quot;&gt;my list of missing Denver mint coins&lt;/a&gt; to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Chinese cities</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So Lori is in western China, having passed through Urumqi (a city of 2 000 000-ish) to Kashgar (a city of 200 000-ish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Chinese cities with populations above 1 000 000 is pretty staggering -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_by_population&quot;&gt;58 in all&lt;/a&gt;. For comparison, the US has only &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population&quot;&gt;9 cities with a population over 1 000 000&lt;/a&gt;. If Urumqi, ranked 33 by population in China, were in the US, it would nudge out Phoenix for 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; place.&lt;/p&gt;

Technically, I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racingtheplanet.com/&quot;&gt;Racing the Planet&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4deserts.com/gobimarch/&quot;&gt;Gobi March&lt;/a&gt; actually occurs in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taklamakan&quot;&gt;Taklamakan Desert&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi&quot;&gt;Gobi Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The Taklamakan is bounded by &quot;the Kunlun Mountains to the south [the border range of northern Tibet], and Pamir Mountains [which cut north through Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, touching western China] and Tian Shan [Tajikistan as far east as Urumqi]...to the west and north&quot;. The Taklamakan comprises most of the area of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Basin&quot;&gt;Tarim Basin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

                <title>Kelly's Cool Tools</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been promoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/&quot;&gt;Kelly's Cool Tools&lt;/a&gt; to friends and family for years. It is filled with gadgets and tips and such. Here are some of the things I've told people about, and a fair number of the items have become gifts I've given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Guide to world's best festivals&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;world_party_cover-sm.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/world_party_cover-sm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;136&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;
All the world is a party; you just have to know where to look. My favorite
&quot;big happys&quot; are traditional religious festivals, which can't be beat
for color, intensity and otherness. This Rough Guide serves as a good
guide to some of the world's most interesting celebrations. Besides the
famous (Mardi Gras, Kuhm Mela), and the infamous (full moon in Hat Rin,
Thailand, Love Parade in Berlin), it also lists a hundred smaller
lesser known, but still incredible festivals. It's crammed with color
photos, history, reviews, and tips. You could map out a pretty good
journey trying to keep up with the possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000905.php&quot;&gt;Rails-to-Trails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;No-car roads&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;rail_bridge.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/rail_bridge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;
Rails-to-Trails (or rail trails) are roads without cars.  They are where railways go when they die. Bicycles love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year 2,000 miles of railways in the US are abandoned. So far, about
half of the 300,000 miles railways built by 1916 (the railroad peak)
have been taken out of service. Some 13,000 of those miles have been
repurposed into bike/hike trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why they're great: 1) You get paths with flat to gentle slopes, 2) no cars,
3) no strip development, and 4) often passing through small towns.
These wide, sculpted, relaxing paths are perfect for hiking, horseback,
cross-country skiing, skates and particularly bicycles. While most of
the rails-to-trails are less than 5 miles long, there are 10 in the
country stretching over 100 miles and at least one that is 225
continuous miles. These longer trails are a big hit -- easy, civilized
bicycle tours: gentle rides without having to compete with cars. As far
as I am concerned, riding bicycles on rail trails is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001619.php&quot;&gt;Storm Whistle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Ultra-loud, all-weather noisemaker&lt;/h6&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;stormwhistle_sm.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/stormwhistle_sm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; /&gt;
I found this incredibly loud whistle while putting together a disaster
preparedness kit for my car. I did some non-scientific testing against
my Fox 40 (rated 115 decibels) by having my son blow into each of them
across a soccer field. The Storm (rated 118-120db) definitely sounded
louder (decibels are based on a logarithmic scale with a base of 10, so
the Storm's decibel intensity is almost 3 times the Fox 40). It is also
advertised as working underwater (the chambers clear as you blow). I
haven't tried it underwater yet, but regardless, this is the loudest
whistle I have ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001576.php&quot;&gt;Leatherman Micra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Classic urban survival multi-tool&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;leatherman-micra-sm.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/leatherman-micra-sm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; /&gt;
I'm a computer geek, both by trade and by lifestyle, so I've accumulated
several boxes full of tools for disassembling and reassembling all
sorts of obscure computer stuff. Since I found the Micra, most of
what's in those boxes sits unused in my office. Smaller than most
pocket knives, and with the ability to unfold into a completely handy
pair of snips, the stainless steel Micra contains two functional
flat-blade drivers (micro and &quot;regular&quot;) and a #2 Phillips-equivalent
screwdriver, so I can achieve most anything I need to do inside a
server closet or at a customer's desk. You could opt for the Wave,
which features more tools. However, the less expensive Micra is lighter
(1.75 vs. 8.5 ounces) and smaller (2.5&quot; vs. 4&quot;), and overall it's much
more of an urban survival tool. It comes with tweezers, scissors, nail
file, and a bottle opener, but the features that make it the most
valuable to me are the &quot;Phillips&quot; blade (a flat blade shaped to fit
into a Phillips head) and the micro flat driver blade. I'm constantly
opening stuff - packages from FedEx (knife,) packages of sunflower
kernels (scissors), laptops (micro screwdriver,) data racks (Phillips)
and the like. This tool has everything I use on a daily basis in a
simple, little package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000728.php&quot;&gt;Surefire G2 Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Super-brightest flashlights&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;surefire_g2.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/surefire_g2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; /&gt;
By far the brightest pocketable flashlights these days are powered by a
pair of 3-volt lithium batteries (the kind used in cameras -- 123A).
Smaller than your hand they throw out four times more light than huge
D-cell monsters. Lithium beacons were pioneered by the law enforcement
and military supplier Surefire. They are issued in deluxe $200 plus
anodized versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now catering to the rest of us, Surefire puts the same innards into this cheap(er)
indestructible plastic version -- the G2 Nitrolon for $34. Like the
other Surefires, its xenon bulb is so blindingly bright that it's hot
to the touch after a few minutes. It WILL temporarily blind someone
closeup in the dark. These torches are the opposite of nifty LED lights
which supply a cool light that keeps going forever. Instead these
bright xenon lights exhale the sun while inhaling lithium batteries at
shocking rate; a pair of lithiums will last only one hour uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.spellingbee.com/public/test/publicsample/?page=complete&quot;&gt;national spelling bee effort&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, this would have been a really good score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your score is 25. Congratulations! With a score like that, you could have qualified for the Quarterfinals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Trackback spam</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I had no idea the trackback spam situation was so bad. I decided to check the comments on my site today: no comments. I checked my trackbacks: 555 trackbacks, 554 of them automatically marked as spam. And the other one was spam, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In checking the sources, I found one stand out website for sourcing spam links to my site: weebly.com. The site purports to be an easy-to-use blog provider for the non-technical person, but that's not even the start of the story. Weebly.com appears to be the favored starting point of porn spammers. Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22dog+porn%22+site%3Aweebly.com&amp;btnG=Search&quot;&gt;blogs at weebly&lt;/a&gt; that deal with only a specialized porn topic: seven sites all using this specific phrase. Most other blog sites have no hits on this phrase. Looks to me as if this is the preferred location for trackback spammers.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>John Cleese's apology from A Fish Called Wanda</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is what a &lt;a href=&quot;/sounds/FW-apology.wav&quot;&gt;real apology should sound like&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, Otto has the advantage here of hanging Archie out a window by his ankles at the time, and not everyone will have this edge when requesting an apology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archie: All right, all right, I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto: You're really sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archie: I'm really, really, sorry. I apologize unreservedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto: You take it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archie: I do, I offer a complete and utter retraction. The imputation was totally without basis in fact, and was in no way fair comment, and was motivated purely by malice. And I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you, or your family, and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto: Ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Dev 102</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; the other day. It has a fair amount of interesting programming information, mostly about C# and .NET development.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of links on Firefox plugins ([&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/05/29/5-more-firefox-plugins-any-web-developer-needs/&quot;&gt;Five more FireFox plugins...&lt;/a&gt;], [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/03/30/5-firefox-extensions-any-web-developer-must-have/&quot;&gt;Five FireFox plugins...&lt;/a&gt;]) that I liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748&quot;&gt;GreaseMonkey&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Allows you to customize the way a webpage displays using small bits of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271&quot;&gt;ColorZilla&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Advanced Eyedropper, ColorPicker, Page Zoomer and other colorful goodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2691&quot;&gt;Poster&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
A developer tool for interacting with web services and other web resources that lets you make HTTP requests, set the entity body, and content type. This allows you to interact with web services and inspect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/216&quot;&gt;JavaScript Debugger&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Venkman is the code name for Mozilla's JavaScript Debugger. Venkman aims to provide a powerful JavaScript debugging environment for Mozilla based browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1802&quot;&gt;X-Ray&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
See the tags on a page without viewing the sourcecode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4187&quot;&gt;CSSMate&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Inline CSS Editing Evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5648&quot;&gt;FireShot&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
FireShot is a Firefox extension that creates screenshots of web pages. Unlike other extensions, this plugin provides a set of editing and annotation tools, which let users quickly modify captures and insert text and graphical annotations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60&quot;&gt;Web Developer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/394&quot;&gt;ViewSourceWith&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Open page source, CSS and JS files, modify content, view server side pages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843&quot;&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of development tools at your fingertips while you browse. You can edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't admit to having used them all, partly because I upgraded to FireFox 3.0 this week and very few of these plugins are compatible -- only FireShot and ViewSourceWIth are. I am most excited to add FireShot and FireBug. I'll have to wait for the FF 3.0 version of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2008-06-15: &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843&quot;&gt;Firebug for Firefox 3.0&lt;/a&gt; has finally been released.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really liked a couple of other short articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/08/4-key-differences-between-implicit-and-explicit-interface-implementation/&quot;&gt;Implicit and explicit interface implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/03/16/a-net-memory-leak-you-did-not-think-about/&quot;&gt;.NET memory leak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To sum things up, the safest way to ensure that an object will be collected by the GC is to make it inherit IDisposable and in the Dispose method unsubscribe from all the events you were subscribed to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dev102.com/2008/04/10/how-to-expose-your-collections-safely/&quot;&gt;How to expose your collections safely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;class TreeNode
{
  private List&amp;lt;TreeNode&amp;gt; children = new List&amp;lt;TreeNode&amp;gt;();

  public IList&amp;lt;TreeNode&amp;gt; Children
  {
    get { return children.AsReadOnly(); }
  }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/styles/tables.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;/images/coins/STIL_small.jpg&quot; /&gt;
I'm collecting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_State_Quarters&quot;&gt;US state quarters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;del&gt;I am missing only &lt;del&gt;three&lt;/del&gt; two quarters from the Philadelphia mint: 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/119px-2008_AZ_Proof.png&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;Arizona&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/119px-2008_AK_Proof.png&quot;&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/119px-2008_HI_Proof.png&quot;&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/del&gt; The Denver mint is a different story. I am missing these:&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/120px-Montana_quarter,_reverse_side,_2007.png&quot;&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;,
&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/120px-2007_WY_Proof_Rev.png&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/coins/119px-2008_HI_Proof.png&quot;&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New York, the quarters in circulation are overwhelmingly from Philadelphia. By my estimate, the Philadelphia coins are 90% of the state quarters and Denver are 10%, so collecting Denver coins is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have extras of these Philadelphia quarters available for trading: Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and New Mexico. I've noticed that these coins are encountered less frequently than other Philadelphia mint coins. Please contact me if you are interested in a trade for a coin I don't have.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Pretty code</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to several google-translated Japanese Movable Type blog entries 
[&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.makotokw.com/2007/10/27/movable_type_4googlecodepretti/l&quot;&gt;makotokw&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazuno.biz/2007/05/googlecodeprettify_fizzbuzz.html&quot;&gt;kazuno&lt;/a&gt;, and 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tadateto.net/2007/09/23/0412.html&quot;&gt;tadateto&lt;/a&gt;], 
I've finally figured out how to hack MT to get python code pretty-printed. (To read these Japanese articles, I recommend searching using google and then pressing &lt;em&gt;Translate this page&lt;/em&gt;.) The code is downloaded from 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; 
and the original idea was from 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordaligned.org/&quot;&gt;Thomas Guest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this to work, you have to do four things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add google's prettify.css stylesheet to your header page template&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/mt-static/css/prettify.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add google's prettify.js JavaScript to you header page template&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/mt-static/js/prettify.js&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get your body.onload to call prettyPrint()&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body class=&quot;mt-main-index layout-wtt&quot; onload=&quot;prettyPrint();&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mark the sections that you want pretty-printed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step is the most involved. You have to change three templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Page&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;prettyPrint();&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&amp;lt;MTIfCommentsAccepted&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;$MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;prettyPrint();&lt;/strong&gt;individualArchivesOnLoad(commenter_name)&amp;quot;$&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/MTIfCommentsAccepted&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Entry&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;prettyPrint();&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&amp;lt;MTIfCommentsAccepted&amp;gt;&amp;lt;
    $MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;prettyPrint();&lt;/strong&gt;individualArchivesOnLoad(commenter_name)&amp;quot;$&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/MTIfCommentsAccepted&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comment Preview&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;prettyPrint();&lt;/strong&gt;individualArchivesOnLoad(commenter_name)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2008-06-27: Did I say three templates? I meant five. Here are two more templates to change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Search results&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;prettyPrint();&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Archive index&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&amp;quot;body_onload&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;prettyPrint();&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;google front-ends&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;dictionaries&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;encyclopedias&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;news sources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;news photos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;news videos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;business and people searches&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;everything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an improbably large page of links categorized to be useful.

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using Movable Type and using WebHosting4Life.com as your ISP, you will not be able to get comments and trackbacks to work until you turn off the WebHosting4Life setting, Security Guard. If, whenever you post a comment on your blog, you get this error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webhost4life Application Firewall Alert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your request triggered an alert! If you feel that you have
received this page in error, please contact the
administrator of this web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Login to WebHosting4Life.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go to Security &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select Security Guard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set to OFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me three weeks of googling this before I put in the system request and got this fixed. I hope you find this posting sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm familiar with looking at price and volume and I've seen top-down methods of stock selection, but I haven't seen a really integrated method. In particular, I haven't seen something that gives a good idea of where the market is heading, and that's one of the things this method relies on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gauge the sentiment of a market to determine if the trend is bullish or bearish, and whether a possible high or low is nearby&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Evaluate breadth, volume, and momentum in order to identify triggers to enter the market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find the best performing sectors that are aligned with the market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select the strongest stocks within those sectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've shorted a couple of times, but I think that I have to do it more often to make money in all markets. There aren't a lot of good books out there on shorting, so I am looking forward to working through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some topics covered in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to control risk by linking the placement of your protective stop with your money management and position size&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where not to put your protective stops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why using moving averages as profit targets works well in the early stages of an upmove&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why channels or envelopes are better targets when you are riding a trending stock&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to use support/resistance areas for profit targets and stop losses in long-term position trades&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to adjust your targets when market conditions change or your stock blows through the initial profit target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Money Flow Index and other technical indicators</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The descriptions of technical analysis algorithms are a bit annoying. They are written to calculate a single point, assuming a programming model that is non-vectorized. I really don't get why the algorithms are so poorly described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmlabs.com/reference/default.htm?url=MoneyFlowIndex.htm&quot;&gt;this description&lt;/a&gt; of Money Flow Index as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/MoneyFlowIndex.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;MoneyFlowIndex = 100 - (100 / (1 + MoneyRatio))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the same as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;MoneyFlowIndex = 100 * PositiveMoneyFlow /  (PositiveMoneyFlow + NegativeMoneyFlow)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or even:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;MoneyFlowIndex = 100 * PositiveMoneyFlow / TotalMoneyFlow&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a formula which works even when NegativeMoneyFlow is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just two concepts, PositiveMoneyFlow and TotalMoneyFlow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;pmf = sum(mfi for mfi, reti in zip(mf, returns) if reti &gt; 0)
tmf = sum(mf)
MoneyFlowIndex = pmf / tmf&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;typ = [ (p.high + p.low + p.close) / 3 for p in prices ]
vol = [ p.volume for p in prices ]
returns = [ (typ[i] - typ[i-1]) / typ[i-1] 
    for i in range(1, len(typ)) ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, we turned a price series into typical prices, created daily returns and money flows from the typical prices, produced the positive money flow and total money flow, and finally got the money flow index. What did it buy us to do it with series like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots. The original algorithm totally glosses over the fact that we don't want a single money flow index -- we want a time series of money flow indexes. All of the basic series are viewed through a &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt;, and windowing like this makes the basic algorithm really inefficient. The Positive Money Flow for the range 0..n differs in only two places from the range 1..n+1 (pmf[0] drops and pmf[n+1] is added) but a naive implementation will sum the series as if there were no overlap. To do this properly, we need series that have partial sums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to add up the m-sized windows on data of size n, you can optimize by creating a series that is the running total of the data seen so far and subtracting element[x] from element[x+m] to get the x'th window. You will iterate from 0 to n-m inclusive, giving you n-m+1 windows of size m. Here is how you make your running total:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;def runningTotal(series) :
    result, s = [0], 0
    for ss in series :
        s += ss
        result.append(s)
    return result
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can write a summedSeries() function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;def summedSeries (series, length) :
    s = runningTotal(series)
    for i in xrange(len(s) - length) :
        yield s[i + length] - s[i]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and rewrite the Money Flow Index function like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-py&quot;&gt;pmf = ((mfi if reti &gt; 0 else 0) 
    for mfi, reti in zip(mf, returns) )
return [ 100.0 * pos/tot for pos, tot in 
    zip(summedSeries(pmf, n), summedSeries(mf, n)) ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have an optimized function that works on price and volume time series and returns a Money Flow Index time series. And once you get your head around python, it even feels right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href=&quot;/files/mfi.py.txt&quot;&gt;mfi.py&lt;/a&gt; ] [ &lt;a href=&quot;/files/msft.csv&quot;&gt;msft.csv&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Technical analysis library</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a brief look at the C++ source for &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/ta-lib&quot;&gt;TA-Lib: Technical Analysis Library&lt;/a&gt; today. It's an open source project I mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;../../2008/05/#001654&quot;&gt;other day&lt;/a&gt;. It may well be good code, but reading through it is really hard sledding. It's evidently all machine-generated, and I can't work out where the source is. (If I have the choice of reading machine-generated C++ or the source, I'll choose the source.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not a dead loss. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadoc.org/&quot;&gt;documentation on the associated site&lt;/a&gt; is pretty strong and gives good references. In particular, there are links to FM Labs, and I like the descriptions given of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmlabs.com/reference/&quot;&gt;TA algorithms&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also intrigued by the Technical Analysis Programmer's Toolkit. I'll download a demo and report back on its suitability.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technicalanalysisbook.com/&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. There are several very positive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technicalanalysisbook.com/reviews/&quot;&gt;reviews of the book&lt;/a&gt; from Brett Steenbarger and Charles Kirk, two traders I really respect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes&lt;/i&gt;, Brian Shannon takes the reader through the essentials of technical analysis and then illustrates how to integrate those into a coherent trading methodology. From the phases of stock movement to price/volume relationships and risk management, Brian brings his topics to life with concrete and practical illustrations and explanations. This is an excellent resource for all technically-oriented traders; anyone who has enjoyed Brian's video insights on the Alpha Trends blog will surely appreciate the way he synthesizes those lessons in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett N. Steenbarger, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brian contacted me awhile back to read and provide a review of his new book &lt;i&gt;Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes&lt;/i&gt;, I couldn't have been more excited. Brian has been blogging about stocks for a long time and his video chart presentations are a unique offering that many find useful. His intense passion for the market and deep love of the game itself is evident in everything Brian does and shares with his readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Brian's book is an excellent resource because he is great instructor. Unlike many books on trading written by traders who frankly have a difficult time explaining their methods, Brian shows his skills by breaking down relatively complex ideas in a straightforward manner. Ultimately this makes his book particularly good for traders who are just starting out on the learning curve and those who've found other trading books too complex or difficult to implement in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Kirk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn't heard of Brian Shannon before but I am really looking forward to getting my hands on this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHESS is a tool for systematically testing multithreaded code. Given a concurrent test, CHESS systematically drives the test along all possible thread interleavings. It uses model-checking techniques to explore effectively the enormously large state space of interleavings and provides quantified coverage guarantees. CHESS can check for assertions, deadlocks, livelocks, and data races. On finding an error, CHESS can reproduce the thread interleaving that exposed an error. CHESS is research tool developed by Microsoft Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is so great. Hulu, a website I had not even heard of until today, has TV shows streamed over the internet. For most people, this would be no big deal. I have no cable, though, and use the TV only for watching DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am catching up on &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; episodes which I would otherwise have to wait until, oh, September, to see on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A one-link YouTube post. Student talks through his calculus problems, set to Gloria Gaynor's &lt;i&gt;I Will Survive&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;So I thought back to calculus,
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz
And to problems just like this.
And just like that when I had given up all hope,
I said, &quot;Nope! There's just one way to find that slope!&quot;&lt;/pre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;And so now I -- I will derive.
Find the derivative of x position with respect to time.
It's as easy as can be
Just have to take dx/dt.
I will derive --I will derive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles are based on reviewing cognitive psychology literature
concerning how people process information to make judgments on incomplete and ambiguous information.

I then translated the technical reports into language that intelligence analysts can understand and interpreted the relevance of these findings to the problems intelligence analysts face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>A Map for Saturday</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a 90 minute DVD about the backpackers' life. Lifted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001748.php&quot;&gt;Cool Tools&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't watch this documentary unless you are ready to quit your job.
It's about the joys and woes of long-term traveling. It's impossible to watch this fun film and not confront the fact that you are here instead of there, out on the road, soaking up the mysteries of the world, with all-you-can-eat $3 dinners and $5 rooms, backpacking around the world for a year, as the filmmaker himself did. This kind of vagabonding is more a state of mind than a state of motion. Something weird happens when you travel longer than 10 days, and that wonderful transformation (which no one can explain to their family when they return) is what this superbly written, fabulously edited, deeply personal and wonderfully likeable documentary is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Weber 87886 Chimney Starter</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U9VV?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=iwebtherefore-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00004U9VV&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Weber_chimney.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Barbecuing is occasionally complicated by unreliable charcoal bricks. Sometimes they don't start even when you douse them with that nasty kerosene fire starter. I'm expecting that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Weber-87886-Chimney-Starter/dp/B00004U9VV/ref=nosim/iwebtherefore-20&quot;&gt;this low-tech solution from Weber&lt;/a&gt; will work better. It's basically a custom-made chimney for igniting charcoal bricks. The coals draw air from the bottom and the fire spreads up the chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2008-07-17: I've been using this product for two months now and I have a few comments to add:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No liquid fire starter required&lt;br /&gt;
Or recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensity&lt;br /&gt;
Within a short period, the fire is consistently red-hot. The coals are amazingly hot throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of starting&lt;br /&gt;
Every time I have used this, I've had one-match fires. Just one match was needed to get it started. You put two sheets of newspaper in the bottom and that's enough to get the coals started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Programming challenge: find top values in unsorted array</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was given a programming problem for a pre-interview job screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implementation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a class which implements either the C# or Java interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the two methods defined in the interface. FindMaxValue should return the single highest integer. FindTopNValues should return a list of the highest 'n' values in the source list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any assumptions or design choices made during the implementation should be documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C# interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;namespace Test
{
   public interface IFindTopValues
   {
      int FindMaxValue(int[] values);
      int[] FindTopNValue(int[] values, int count);
   }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Test cases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the test cases which you would implement for this class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;/files/programming-challenge-find-top.html&quot;&gt;the solution&lt;/a&gt; I produced. It uses a C# generic PriorityQueue class. Have a look -- it's useful, reusable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update (2008-05-15): I noticed that Julian Bucknall had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boyet.com/Articles/PriorityQueueLimited.html&quot;&gt;change to his priority queue&lt;/a&gt; that ordered entries by priority and time of entry. I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;/files/better-priorityqueue.html&quot;&gt;update my code&lt;/a&gt; to provide the same ability.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Grammatical pet peeve: the reason is because</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a friend wrote about our Ultimate Frisbee field and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;the reason we moved the field to the dust bowl was  because of the uneven nature of the south part of our field (23 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a real problem with this construction. It uses a noun clause (&quot;the reason we moved the field to the dust bowl&quot;) as the subject of the sentence and tacks on the very weak &quot;was because&quot; to express the idea. &quot;The reason ... was because...&quot; is never necessary nor advisable. There are many more direct alternatives, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;we moved the field to the dust bowl because of the uneven nature of the south part of our field (20 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or even:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;we moved the field to the dust bowl because the south part of our field is uneven (17 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we've removed 6 words from a 23-word sentence. I might even go for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;we moved the field to the dust bowl because the south field is uneven (14 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but really, I have a problem only with &quot;the reason ... was because.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>KMN, KMN, KMN: Language that makes you say OMG</title>
                <description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kolesnikova13-2008may13,0,4111689.story&quot;&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; on teenagers' use of language picked up from the web and text messaging.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language that makes you say OMG&lt;br /&gt;
Teens are letting emoticons and other forms of chat-speak slip into their essays and homework.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between a person LOLing and
crying -- but I am definitely weeping. The cause for my
earth-shattering depression is an April 25 Pew Research Center study
that polled 12- to 17-year-olds on their attitudes about writing. A
heart-stopping 38% said they let chat-speak -- such as LOL (for
&quot;laughing out loud&quot;), ROFL (&quot;rolling on the floor laughing&quot;), BRB (&quot;be
right back&quot;), TTYL (&quot;talk to ya later&quot;) -- slip into essays and
homework.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I propose a new chat term: KMN. &quot;Kill me now.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly Successful New York City Hedge Fund seeks an outstanding C#/.NET developer to work on Enterprise trading applications and market data systems. Prior financial experience is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 4+ years experience designing and implementing web-based applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HDB: the web-based applications experience requirement disqualifies me. This is the only C# developer position that Hudson has in New York, so I can see why &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwebthereforeiam.com/jobs/2008/05/#001586&quot;&gt;Manny Thandi&lt;/a&gt; is not calling back. They have only 12 development positions going back to mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is putting positions on hold. They are not hiring but things could change in June. He believes they may be having layoffs. Many companies are interviewing and not hiring. His Morgan Stanley contact told him, &quot;Don't work on these jobs -- nothing is happening until June.&quot; He describes it as &quot;not a very good market, brutal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked about contract positions. They do do them, but he has nothing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reminds me that the feedback from Morgan Stanley in Purchase, NY, was positive so I should hang tight with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobresults.aspx?strCrit=rawWords=(accountdid:a7c2t95wl8ktr2yht3s+accountdid:a7c0h66yzwblnf89s6x)&quot;&gt;shortage of positions on the CODGI.com website&lt;/a&gt; indicates this may be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Backfilling content</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So I've finally backfilled content from early 2004 to the present. I eventually did get all my content out of notepad.yahoo.com, format it as a Movable Type import file (including getting the separators, date format, and unix newlines correct), and uploaded it to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the content is pretty poorly formatted, so it will be months before I have it in a truly usable format. Until then, it's all here.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Downloading from notepad.yahoo.com</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of content in notepad.yahoo.com -- links, articles, etc. I'd like to download it, format it programmatically, and post it to my blog. I'd like to do this in python, and I've already tried HTTPBasicAuthHandler and urllib2 with no success -- I get HTML that asks for login, rather than HTML that shows my notepad entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I have tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;import urllib2, base64
username, password = 'hughdbrown@yahoo.com', '?'
passman = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
passman.add_password(None, url, username, password)
auth_handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(passman)
opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_handler)
urllib2.install_opener(opener)

req = urllib2.Request('&lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad.yahoo.com/%27%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://notepad.yahoo.com/')&lt;/a&gt;
base64string = base64.encodestring('%s:%s' % (username, password))[:-1]
req.add_header(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;Basic %s&quot; % base64string)

handle = urllib2.urlopen(req)&lt;br /&gt;print handle.read()&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have an idea of how to get into notepad.yahoo.com to download notes?&lt;/p&gt;

[2008-05-08]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got email from Alex Angelopoulos who had this recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I used WSH because I'm most used to it, even though it was Python that initially got me excited about scripting. I also _write_ about admin scripting, and the usual name of the game is &quot;what can you do with the bits already in the box?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;That said, what I'm doing could easily be translated into Python using its COM interop. All I do is automate the browser. This is of course dramatically more resource-intensive than curl, but it means that any ugly bits of the page are handled exactly the way the browser handles them, and the job changes from a lot of parsing and submission-handling to selecting elements by name or id and then setting values or invoking actions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I've attached a demo of it so far. It logs in, then takes the first page - presumably listing all of the notes - and returns the URLs for each and every note. It's possible to push this farther, of course, actually walking through the notes and grabbing the content of each one.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Notes on the demo:&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;(1) It's VBScript. I know, don't say it. : / However, I correctly cased object properties and methods so translation should be straightforward if you want to Pythonize. The only terminally ugly bits should be the setAttribute methods; those are both arguments and should be parenthesized in more rational languages. To run the demo as-is, you need to modify the username/password, and then I advise running from the console WSH host cscript so you don't get lots of popups for the URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;(2) It uses hardcoded username/password which I've set topside (and will likely make into commandline arguments in a better version).&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;(3) If you haven't done IE automation before, note the little readyState wait loops. You need to wait for IE to finish each navigation event, and in the case of complex documents, it's also necessary to wait for the document to render.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm not certain what you _really_ want to do from here - or if the browser automation approach isn't feasible for some reason. What I particularly like about this approach, though, is that you can work with objects instead of text, and it's always guaranteed to work with pages designed to the &quot;Well, it worked in Internet Explorer...&quot; spec.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he provided WSH code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;username = &quot;yyyyyyyy@yahoo.com&quot;
passwd = &quot;xxxxxxx&quot;

Dim ie: Set ie = CreateObject(&quot;InternetExplorer.Application&quot;)

' Initial navigation needed to stabilize IE
ie.Navigate(&quot;about:blank&quot;)
Do Until ie.readyState = 4 : WScript.Sleep 100: Loop

' Show IE for debugging; can be hidden once it works.
ie.Visible = true

ie.Navigate &quot;http://notepad.yahoo.com&quot;

Do Until ie.readyState = 4 : WScript.Sleep 100: Loop

Dim doc: Set doc = ie.Document

Set usernameNode = doc.getElementById(&quot;username&quot;)
usernameNode.setAttribute &quot;value&quot;, username

Set passwordNode = doc.getElementById(&quot;passwd&quot;)
passwordNode.setAttribute &quot;value&quot;, passwd

' There's only one form, but it doesn't have an id -
' so we get by tagname and treat it like a collection...
'Dim body: Set body = doc.Body
Set forms = doc.Body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;form&quot;)
For each form in forms
	if form.getAttribute(&quot;name&quot;) = &quot;login_form&quot; then form.submit()
next

' we're navigating in to the folders.

Do Until ie.readyState = 4 : WScript.Sleep 100: Loop
Set doc = ie.Document

' Apparently the document builds after the browser is technically
' finished navigating. So we wait until the document readyState
' &quot;complete&quot; - yes, it's a text state, not a flag...
Do Until doc.readyState = &quot;complete&quot;
	WScript.Sleep 100
Loop

Set table = ie.Document.getElementById(&quot;datatable&quot;)

Set links = table.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;)
for each link in links
	WScript.Echo link.href
next&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[2008-05-09]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that reminded me that I have used &lt;a href=&quot;http://watin.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;WatiN&lt;/a&gt;, a .NET library ostensibly for testing GUIs but really ideal for screen-scraping HTML pages -- particularly because it has Intellisense. So I wrote a program using WatiN that does everything:&lt;/p&gt;

        Queue&amp;lt;YahooLink&amp;gt; notes = new Queue&amp;lt;YahooLink&amp;gt;();
        while (processPages(ie, notes))
          ;

         foreach (YahooLink yl in notes)
         {
           ie.GoTo(yl.Url);
           TextField tf = ie.TextField(Find
             .ById(&quot;charCountTA&quot;));
           Console.WriteLine(tf.Text);
         }
         ie.Link(Find.ById(&quot;Sign Out&quot;)).Click();
       }
     }
  }
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of hacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DateTime parsing failed on 4/30/08 for no apparent reason, so I just hacked up a quick-and-dirty date parser for American-style dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are already logged in to notepad.yahoo.com, it skips the extra log in by catching a throw exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo seems to find it peculiar that I am looking at 2000 notes and pulling them all down. It raises a security warning sometime after I have pulled down a few hundred. Maybe I'll have to add a call to sleep().&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Comments and tracebacks</title>
                <description>I'm sure this will be hard to understand, but I am still working on getting comments and tracebacks working. I wrestled with getting Image::Magick installed; no luck. Then I worked on getting reCaptcha installed just so I could have some captcha provider in my list. That was impeded by my FTP client hanging up, but once I restarted that, it was fine. So now I don't know what the problem is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;reCaptcha is listed as a plugin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reCaptcha is selected as my CAPTCHA provider&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments are set to &lt;i&gt;Immediate approve comments from: Anyone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Registration is set to &lt;i&gt;Anonymous comments&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Require E-mail Address for Anonymous Comments&lt;/i&gt; set&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web Services setting has a Type Key value obtained from SixApart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entire website has been rebuilt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've followed all the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshcarter.com/software/recaptcha&quot;&gt;Adding reCAPTCHA to Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;You'd think it would be fine. So I'll be waiting here for someone to post a comment on how to fix this -- no wait.

                <title>MT snafu</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past 36 hours, my blog has allowed me to create new content and to preview it, but not to actually be able to see it generated in static HTML files. I finally discovered today that I brought this on myself when I inadvertently set Movable Type to use background publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BackgroundPublishing-90.gif&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the bit where it says that a cron job is needed to do the actual publishing? So if you don't actually &lt;b&gt;have&lt;/b&gt; such a cron job, you'll get the result I did: no material published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I really think that, notwithstanding that I don't actually read and write Perl, I should have been able to figure this out. The leading clue was that the system log started to report that source code was missing for using TheSchwartz.pm, which even I could see was some sort of multithreaded load-balancer thingee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&gt;&gt;Internal callback died with: Can't locate List/Util.pm in @INC (@INC contains: [...].) at [...]\mt\extlib/TheSchwartz.pm line 13.&lt;br /&gt;

                <title>Cargo cult programming</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going through some old web material and came across my links on cargo cult. The idea, originally developed by Richard Feynman, is that people develop a false idea of causation and do the wrong things to try to produce the desired effect. &lt;i&gt;Cargo cult programming&lt;/i&gt; has become a common expression in software development to describe &quot;a style of computer programming that is characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose.&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult&quot;&gt;Wikipedia on cargo cults&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cargo cult is any of a group of unorthodox religious movements
appearing in tribal societies in the wake of Western impact, especially
in New Guinea and Melanesia. Cargo cults sometimes maintain that
manufactured western goods (&quot;cargo&quot;) have been created by divine
spirits and are intended for the local indigenous people, but that
white people have unfairly gained control of these objects. Cargo cults
thus focus on overcoming what they perceive as undue 'white' influences
by conducting rituals similar to the white behavior they have observed,
presuming that the ancestors will at last recognize their own and send
them cargo. Thus a characteristic feature of cargo cults is the belief
that spiritual agents will at some future time give much valuable cargo
and desirable manufactured products to the cult members. In other
instances such as on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu, cult members
worship Americans who brought the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above definition, cargo cult is also used in business and
science to refer to a particular type of fallacy whereby ill-considered
effort and ceremony takes place but goes unrewarded due to a flawed
model of causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2006/february/john.php?page=1&quot;&gt;Cargo cults in Melanesia&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island's John Frum movement is a classic example of what anthropologists have called a &quot;cargo cult&quot; -- many of which sprang up in villages in the South Pacific during World War II, when hundreds of thousands of American troops poured into the islands from the skies and seas. As anthropologist Kirk Huffman, who spent 17 years in Vanuatu, explains: &quot;You get cargo cults when the outside world, with all its material wealth, suddenly descends on remote, indigenous tribes.&quot; The locals don't know where the foreigners' endless supplies come from and so suspect they were summoned by magic, sent from the spirit world. To entice the Americans back after the war, islanders throughout the region constructed piers and carved airstrips from their fields. They prayed for ships and planes to once again come out of nowhere, bearing all kinds of treasures: jeeps and washing machines, radios and motorcycles, canned meat and candy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Richard Feynman on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/%7Eloreti/science.html&quot;&gt;cargo cult science&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned 
are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the 
South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw 
airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to 
happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put
fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man 
to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars 
of bamboo sticking out like antennas -- he's the controller -- and they wait 
for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form 
is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't 
work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, 
because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific 
investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the 
planes don't land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Sleep machine: Sound Oasis S-550-03</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sound-Oasis-Sound-Conditioner-p/s-550-03.htm&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; id=&quot;Sound Oasis&quot; src=&quot;/images/sound_oasis_S-550-03.gif&quot;  width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Okay, so this is my favorite sleep sound machine. A few of the things that make it so good in my view:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sounds don't repeat very quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sound quality is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can add cards to extend the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a great big button to turn it on and off (as opposed to many machines that have combination volume and on-off)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sound can be played for a set time (30-, 60-, or 90-minutes) and it automatically shuts off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sound fades out gradually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/&quot;&gt;SleepWellBaby&lt;/a&gt; has the best prices: the unit for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sound-Oasis-Sound-Conditioner-p/s-550-03.htm&quot;&gt;$49.95&lt;/a&gt; and the extension cards for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=SC-200&quot;&gt;$14.95&lt;/a&gt;. I got these cards:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhythms of the Sea Sound Card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wilderness Journey Sound Card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The built-in sounds are pretty good without resorting to expansion cards. My wife is partial to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sounds/summernight.mp3&quot;&gt;summer night sounds&lt;/a&gt; whereas I prefer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sleepwellbaby.com/Sounds/oceansurf.mp3&quot;&gt;ocean surf&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Word Aligned</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recent favorite weblog. I first found it when I was looking up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordaligned.org/articles/the-maximum-subsequence-problem&quot;&gt;maximum subsequence problem&lt;/a&gt; -- how to find the longest positive run from a series of positive and negative numbers. It's the sort of thing you'd be interested in if you were checking portfolio returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn a lot every time I go to this site, particularly about coding in python. I really liked recent entries on itertools.groupby():&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;import itertools
import operator

city_list = [('Decatur', 'AL'), ('Huntsville', 'AL'), ('Selma', 'AL'), ('Anchorage', 'AK'), ('Nome', 'AK'),
 ('Flagstaff', 'AZ'), ('Phoenix', 'AZ'), ('Tucson', 'AZ')]

a = itertools.groupby(city_list, operator.itemgetter(1))

print [ (state, &quot;,&quot;.join(i[0] for i in it)) for s ]&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some favorite articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordaligned.org/articles/top-ten-tags&quot;&gt;Find top-x items in unsorted array&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordaligned.org/articles/echo&quot;&gt;Python code to trace function execution (with arguments)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>NullScript: The language about nothing</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm moving my old website over, and the first order of business is to put up the popular old content. And what's more popular than &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/NScript.asp&quot;&gt;NullScript&lt;/a&gt;, the language about nothing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical aside: since my website was upgraded to a new server, none of the NullScript links has worked because IIS appears to reject any file that begins with NUL*. So I renamed all my NullScriptx.* files to NScriptx.*. I expect that my incoming links will all be broken. At least google will patch this up in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apparently, you can't even title an entry with Null*.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Rules for Parallel Programming for Multicore</title>
                <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/201804248&quot;&gt;James Reinders on parallel programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming for multicore processors poses new challenges. Here are
eight rules for multicore programming to help you be successful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think parallel. Approach all problems looking for the
parallelism. Understand where parallelism is, and organize your
thinking to express it. Decide on the best parallel approach before
other design or implementation decisions. Learn to &quot;Think Parallel.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program using abstraction. Focus on writing code to express parallelism, but
avoid writing code to manage threads or processor cores. Libraries,
OpenMP, and Intel Threading Building Blocks are all examples of using
abstractions. Do not use raw native threads (pthreads, Windows threads,
Boost threads, and the like). Threads and MPI are the assembly
languages for parallelism. They offer maximum flexibility, but require
too much time to write, debug, and maintain. Your programming should be
at a high-enough level that your code is about your problem, not about
thread or core management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program in tasks (chores), not threads (cores). Leave the mapping of tasks to threads or processor cores as a distinctly separate operation in your program, preferably an abstraction you are using that handles thread/core management for you.
Create an abundance of tasks in your program, or a task that can be
spread across processor cores automatically (such as an OpenMP loop).
By creating tasks, you are free to create as many as you can without
worrying about oversubscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with the option to
turn concurrency off. To make debugging simpler, create programs that
can run without concurrency. This way, when debugging, you can run
programs first with--then without--concurrency, and see if both runs fail
or not. Debugging common issues is simpler when the program is not
running concurrently because it is more familiar and better supported
by today's tools. Knowing that something fails only when run
concurrently hints at the type of bug you are tracking down. If you
ignore this rule and can't force your program to run in only one
thread, you'll spend too much time debugging. Since you want to have
the capability to run in a single thread specifically for debugging, it
doesn't need to be efficient. You just need to avoid creating parallel
programs that require concurrency to work correctly, such as many
producer-consumer models. MPI programs often violate this rule, which
is part of the reason MPI programs can be problematic to implement and
debug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using locks. Simply say &quot;no&quot; to locks. Locks
slow programs, reduce their scalability, and are the source of bugs in
parallel programs. Make implicit synchronization the solution for your
program. When you still need explicit synchronization, use atomic
operations. Use locks only as a last resort. Work hard to design the
need for locks completely out of your program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools
and libraries designed to help with concurrency. Don't &quot;tough it out&quot;
with old tools. Be critical of tool support with regards to how it
presents and interacts with parallelism. Most tools are not yet ready
for parallelism. Look for threadsafe libraries--ideally ones that are
designed to utilize parallelism themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use scalable
memory allocators. Threaded programs need to use scalable memory
allocators. Period. There are a number of solutions and I'd guess that
all of them are better than &lt;i&gt;malloc().&lt;/i&gt; Using scalable memory
allocators speeds up applications by eliminating global bottlenecks,
reusing memory within threads to better utilize caches, and
partitioning properly to avoid cache line sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design
to scale through increased workloads. The amount of work your program
needs to handle increases over time. Plan for that. Designed with
scaling in mind, your program will handle more work as the number of
processor cores increase. Every year, we ask our computers to do more
and more. Your designs should favor using increases in parallelism to
give you advantages in handling bigger workloads in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote these rules with explicit mention of threading everywhere. Only
rule #7 is specifically related to threading. Threading is not the only
way to get value out of multicore. Running multiple programs or
multiple processes is often used, especially in server applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules will work well for you to get the most out of multicore.
Some will grow in importance over the next 10 years, as the number of
processor cores rises and we see an increase in the diversity of the
cores themselves. The coming of heterogeneous processors and NUMA, for
instance, makes rule #3 more and more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should understand all eight and take all eight to heart. I look
forward to any comments you may have about these rules or parallelism
in general.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickfixengine.org/&quot;&gt;QuickFIX&lt;/a&gt; is a full-featured open source FIX engine, currently compatible with the FIX 4.0-4.4 spec. It runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. API's are available for C++, Java, .NET, Python and Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to documents&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Lonely Planet scandal</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/news/article3746887.ece&quot;&gt;Lonely Planet scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has recently been a minor scandal in the tourist book publication business because of the admission of a Lonely Planet editor that he did not always go to the places he described in his books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kohnstamm says that he was in San Francisco at the time. &quot;They didn't pay me enough to go to Colombia,&quot; he told &lt;i&gt;The Australian Herald
Sun.&lt;/i&gt; So he &quot;got the information from a chick I was dating who was an
intern in the Colombian Consulate&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

[...]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from his home in Seattle, Kohnstamm told &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt; that his
comments had been misrepresented. He denied inventing content. However, he
stood by his original argument that overstretched and underfunded freelance
travel writers, whose recommendations are relied upon by generations of
travellers, cannot possibly visit every budget hotel and jungle outpost they
are asked to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/strongtravelstrong-death-of-the-guidebook-lost-in-a-cutthroat-world/2008/04/18/1208025469923.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2&quot;&gt;Death of the guidebook: lost in a cutthroat world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidebook publishers will deny this, but the travel publishing industry is bound to exploit demand for what is widely seen as a glamour job - travel and get paid for it. But with so many competing guidebook series, many titles do not generate sales revenue that justifies the legwork that results in genuine personal recommendations. Most publishers who make claims to the contrary are being disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netflixprize.com/&quot;&gt;NetFlix&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a programming contest with a $1 million prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netflix Prize seeks to substantially improve the accuracy of predictions about how much someone is going to love a movie based on their movie preferences.  Improve it enough and you win one (or more) Prizes.  Winning the Netflix Prize improves our ability to connect people to the movies they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pyflix.python-hosting.com/&quot;&gt;Pyflix&lt;/a&gt; is a small package written in Python that provides an easy entry point for getting up and running in the Netflix Prize competition. It combines an efficient storage scheme with an intuitive high-level API that allows contestants to focus on the real problem, the recommendation system algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;$ python -m cProfile -o prof.dump program.py&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then load the prof.dump output file and analyse it using the pstats module. For example, to find which 10 functions took the most time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import pstats 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prof = pstats.Stats(&quot;prof.dump&quot;) 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prof.sort_stats(&quot;time&quot;).print_stats(10) &lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>Maximum subsequence</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordaligned.org/articles/the-maximum-subsequence-problem&quot;&gt;WordAlinged.org&lt;/a&gt;. The simple solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;def maximum_subsequence(seq):
    maxsofar, maxendinghere = 0, 0
    for s in seq:
        # invariant: maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate
        # are accurate up to s
        maxendinghere = max(maxendinghere + s, 0)
        maxsofar = max(maxsofar, maxendinghere)
    return maxsofar&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A streaming library for reuse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;def stream_accumulate(stream):
    total = 0
    for s in stream:
        total += s
        yield total

def stream_floor(stream):
    m = 0
    for s in stream:
        m = min(m, s)
        yield m

def stream_diff(s, t):
    import itertools
    for ss, tt in itertools.izip(s, t):
        yield ss - tt

def stream_diff(s, t):
    import itertools
    import operator
    return itertools.imap(operator.sub, s, t)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A maximum subsequence solution that uses the stream library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;import stream

def maximum_subsequence_stream(ss):
    &quot;Return the stream of max sum contiguous subsequences of the input iterable.&quot;
    accu1, accu2 = itertools.tee(stream.accumulate(ss))
    return stream.ceil(stream.diff(accu1, stream.floor(accu2, baseline=0)))

def maximum_subsequence(ss):
    &quot;Return the max sum of a contiguous subsequence of the input iterable.&quot;
    return stream.last(maximum_subsequence_stream(ss))&lt;/pre&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that python's itertools.groupby() function is pretty cool. Here is some sample code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;import itertools
import operator

city_list = [
  ('Decatur', 'AL'), ('Huntsville', 'AL'), ('Selma', 'AL'),
  ('Anchorage', 'AK'), ('Nome', 'AK'),
  ('Flagstaff', 'AZ'), ('Phoenix', 'AZ'), ('Tucson', 'AZ')]

a = itertools.groupby(city_list, operator.itemgetter(1))
print [ (state, &quot;,&quot;.join(i[0] for i in it)) 
  for state, it in a ]&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>Quotes from The Great Gatsby</title>
                <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final sentence&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... And one fine morning -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tom and Daisy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>How Not to Talk to Your Kids</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/&quot;&gt;How Not to Talk to Your Kids&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] those who think that innate intelligence is the key to success begin to discount the importance of effort. I am smart, the kids' reasoning goes; I don't need to put out effort. Expending effort becomes stigmatized-it's public proof that you can't cut it on your natural gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the opinion of cognitive scientist Daniel T. Willingham, a teacher who praises a child may be unwittingly sending the message that the student [has] reached the limit of his innate ability, while a teacher who criticizes a pupil conveys the message that he can improve his performance even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students turn to cheating because they haven't developed a strategy for handling failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take-home points lifted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2007/03/how-not-to-talk-to-your-kids.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don't tell them they are smart... tell them they worked hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't praise them for being good at something... tell them they are getting better through practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't tell them they are bad at something... tell them how to do it right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;Getting rich&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a lot of money, don't make money your goal. Make serving a lot of people your goal. If you hit that target enough times, you'll get your reward. That reward will be money, and you can do whatever you choose with that money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember that money is only the reward for hitting your target - it's not the target itself. Always keep your priorities straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mnemonic for remembering the last names of the American presidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why aren't just, moral men attracting judicious voters? Historically,
the parties tried for plurality by listing jobs, growth, honest
government as candidates' highest concerns. More recently, though,
White House campaigns have refined their election knowhow: Just need
Fox channel running biased coverage -- Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Product vision elevator test</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A product vision model helps team members pass the elevator test -- the ability to explain the project to someone within two minutes. It comes from Geoffrey Moore's book &lt;i&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/i&gt;. It follows the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;for (target customer)&lt;br /&gt;
who (statement of need or opportunity)&lt;br /&gt;
the (product name)&lt;br /&gt;
is a (product category)&lt;br /&gt;
that (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)&lt;br /&gt;
unlike (primary competitive alternative)&lt;br /&gt;
our product (statement of primary differentiation)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a product vision statement helps teams remain focused on the critical aspects of the product, even when details are changing rapidly. It is very easy to get focused on the short-term issues associated with a 2-4 week development iteration and lose track of the overall product vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Beers is the largest supplier of rough diamonds in the world. Beginning in 2001, Plaintiffs in several states filed lawsuits against De Beers in state and federal courts alleging that De Beers unlawfully monopolized the supply of diamonds, conspired to fix, raise, and control diamond prices, and issued false and misleading advertising. De Beers denies it violated the law or did anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Settlement Agreement provides that $22.5 Million be distributed to the Direct Purchaser Class, and that $272.5 Million will be distributed to the Indirect Purchaser Class. De Beers also agrees to refrain from engaging in certain conduct that violates federal and state antitrust laws and submit to the jurisdiction of the Court to enforce the Settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you got your claim in. The deadline was a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Jumpers: The fatal grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge.</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013fa_fact&quot;&gt;Jumpers: The fatal grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorker article on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge. Fascinating in a macabre way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-10-12: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/11suicide.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;Golden Gate Managers Vote to Build Suicide Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO -- After decades of debate, and unknown numbers of lost lives, the board that controls the Golden Gate Bridge took a major step toward building a suicide barrier on Friday, voting to erect a net under the span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-to-1 vote came after several failed efforts over the years to support a physical barrier on the Golden Gate, where troubled souls have long leapt to their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current plan still must pass a final environmental review, including a look at how a net might affect pelicans and cormorants, which frequent the bridge. It also needs financing: the estimated cost of the metal net is $40 million to $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nice of them to do this after so long but still a bit troubling that it might be blocked by its estimated effect on pelicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>End of WWII</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Revisionist theory that Russian invasion of Manchuria (Operation August Storm) caused Japanese surrender, not American atomic bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_2.html&quot;&gt;edge.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning of August 9, Soviet troops invaded Manchuria. Six hours after hearing this news, the Supreme Council was in session. News of the Nagasaki bombing, which happened the same morning, only reached the Council after the session started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The August 9 session of the Supreme Council resulted in the decision to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emperor, in his rescript to the military forces ordering their surrender, does not mention the nuclear bombs but emphasizes the historical analogy between the situation in 1945 and the situation at the end of the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. In 1895 Japan had defeated China, but accepted a humiliating peace when European powers led by Russia moved into Manchuria and the Russians occupied Port Arthur. By making peace, the emperor Meiji had kept the Russians out of Japan. Emperor Hirohito had this analogy in his mind when he ordered the surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_August_Storm&quot;&gt;wikipedia: Operation August Storm&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsuyoshi Hasegawa's research has led him to conclude that the atomic bombings were not the principal reason for capitulation. Instead, he contends, it was the swift and devastating Soviet victories on the mainland in the week following Joseph Stalin's August 8 declaration of war that forced the Japanese message of surrender on August 15, 1945. His claim, however, has been criticized because it ignores the fact that the Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo was unaware of how badly the fighting in Manchuria was going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1543754,00.html&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It [the use of atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki] did not bring about surrender. With 62 Japanese cities destroyed by firebombs and napalm, Japan was not overwhelmed by the destruction of one more. The army minister, General Korechika Anami, told the supreme war council that he would fight on. What actually brought about surrender was the combination of the Soviet Union's entry into the war on August 8 and the US decision to let Japan retain the emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The Clapton, Kravitz, and Young covers are worth watching. The Brian Ferry one is pretty anemic. YouTube has many worse covers, including U2's, that I wouldn't even link to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m0u8U3MP-8&quot;&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EoJUkF3r7E&quot;&gt;Lenny Kravitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9ISzNAqytE&quot;&gt;Clapton and Kravitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_tJnj2j5kI&quot;&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkcsm9Ask_A&quot;&gt;Brian Ferry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2009-04-09: The Clapton and Kravitz links have been removed from YouTube for copyright violation. Sigh. They were great. Still, try the new Clapton and Kravitz version.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Kelly criterion</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[HDB 2008-06-04] This text is lifted from some website and I can't remember where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in the theory, here are the mathematical steps I used to generalize the above problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's define some variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;F = % of your bankroll that you invest in A
W1 = ROI of Product 1 = 30%
W2 = ROI of Product 2 = 10%
W3 = ROI of Product 3 = 12%
W4 = ROI of No Products Launching = -15%
P1 = Probability of Product 1 Launching
P2 = Probability of Product 2 Launching
P3 = Probability of Product 3 Launching
P4 = Probability of No Product Launching
B = Initial Bankroll
B' = Future Bankroll after N such investments
M = The Geometric Mean of N such investments&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above infomation, we can formulate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;B' = B * (1 + W1*F)^(P1*N) * 
    (1 + W2*F)^(P2*N) * 
    (1 + W3*F)^(P3*N) * 
    (1 + W4*F)^(P4*N)

M^N = B'/B = (1 + W1*F)^(P1*N) * 
    (1 + W2*F)^(P2*N) * 
    (1 + W3*F)^(P3*N) * 
    (1 + W4*F)^(P4*N)
M = [(1 + W1*F)^(P1*N) * 
    (1 + W2 * F)^(P2*N) * 
    (1 + W3*F)^(P3*N) * 
    (1 + W4*F)^(P4*N)]^(1/N)
M = (1 + W1*F)^(P1) * 
    (1 + W2*F)^(P2) * 
    (1 + W3*F)^(P3) * 
    (1 + W4*F)^(P4)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to maximize the geometric return M, we need to find F such that the Product Sum of (1+Wi*F)^Pi for all i is maximized. Unfortunately, there is no simple formula that can compute the Kelly Criterion for multiple possible outcomes. Fortunately, with the aid of computer, I constructed an optimization model that will find the Kelly Criterion for you.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Find people on Internet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for someone on the web, the best places to look are google, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;FaceBook&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and ZabaSearch. The most valuable personal facts to narrow your search are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any previous address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date of birth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;middle name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I used all of these to track down classmates for my 25th high school reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                <title>Hosts.txt file to redirect spam/spyware</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Before your PC goes to the web to look up a URL to resolve it into a 32-bit address, it performs a lookup in hosts.txt. Putting known spammers and the like into your hosts.txt and having them resolve to the local host cause these sites to be unreachable from your machine -- a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to use this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Download hosts.txt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt&quot;&gt;www.mvps.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Copy file to %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.txt&quot;&gt;Hosts.txt file to redirect spam/spyware&lt;/a&gt;]

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we're building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0xkh23z7.aspx&quot;&gt;Imperative Security&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You might use imperative syntax for demands and overrides instead of declarative syntax when information that you need in order to initialize the permission state becomes known only at run time. For example, if you want to ensure that callers have permission to read a certain file, but you do not know the name of that file until run time, use an imperative demand. You might also choose to use imperative checks instead of declarative checks when you need to determine at run time whether a condition holds and, based on the result of the test, make a security demand (or not).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>.Net code coverage: NCover</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Three reasons to use NCover:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use NCover to show you where the gaps are. NCover helps you test intelligently by revealing which tests haven't been written yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping code coverage high with NCover reduces time-to-market and helps find problems early, preventing buggy releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase confidence in your project by using NCover to drive code coverage higher. Then ship without worries and on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of cool math problems. Challenges you to solve math problems, typically by writing computer programs (unless you've memorized the first one million primes -- then you could do these in your head). I've done 70 or so and am trying to stay in the top 500 problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>BUILDING THE ADX INDICATOR</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hal-pc.org/~tradesig/presentations/2005-01.pdf&quot;&gt;BUILDING THE ADX INDICATOR&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calculate the Directional Movement System:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the Directional movement for today&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
+DM = Today's High - Yesterday's High (when price moves upward)
-DM = Yesterday's Low - Today's Low (when price moves downward)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot have both +DM and -DM on the same day. If there is an outside day (where both calculations are
positive) then the larger of the two results is taken. An inside day (where both calculations are negative) will
always equal zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the true range for the day. True range is the largest of:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Today's High - Today's Low,
Today's High - Yesterday's Close, and
Yesterday's Close - Today's Low&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
+DM14 = exponential moving average* of +DM
-DM14= exponential moving average* of -DM
TR14 = exponential moving average* of True Range&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the Directional Indicators:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
+DI14 = +DM14 divided by TR14
-DI14 = -DM14 divided by TR14&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the components of the Average Directional Movement Index (ADX):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the DI Difference:&lt;br /&gt;
Record the difference between +DI14 and -DI14 as a positive number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the Directional Index (DX):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
DX = DI Difference divided by the sum of +DI14 and -DI14
ADX = the exponential moving average* of DX&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;... you can go through thousands of job applications and quite frankly never see a great software developer. Not a one. Here is why this happens. The great software developers, indeed, the best people in every field, are quite simply never on the market.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Review of internet dating tips</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet comic book reviewer takes a break &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoopla-comics.blogspot.com/2007/06/hoopla-episode-25-reviews-of-dating.html&quot;&gt;to look into internet dating tips&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;em&gt;Kiss her softly, then kiss her passionately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another sequentially challenging one. What you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to do is, you &lt;em&gt;don't &lt;/em&gt;want to kiss her passionately and then kiss her softly. That would just be seriously messed up. I've made up a little mnemonic device to help me keep it straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;First kiss soft, next one passionate,&lt;br /&gt;
In World War Hulk, My green homey be smashin' it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archibase.net/archinews/14805.html&quot;&gt;10 tallest statues in the world&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure if these really are the 10 tallest. Includes Motherland in Kiev, Peter I in Moscow, and Motherland in Volgograd. Plus Statue of Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/singleton.html&quot;&gt;Implementing the Singleton Pattern in C#&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
State of the art answer on coding a singleton. The main problem is to have thread-safe access to the singleton while doing lazy construction.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Watch Options to Determine Potential Takeover Targets</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestreet.com/_email/pom/pomoptionsalerts/10360554.html&quot;&gt;Watch Options to Determine Potential Takeover Targets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been an increasing use of options to both identify and participate in profiting from the current buyout frenzy. Most of the focus has been on looking for a surge in the volume of call activity and an increase in the implied volatility in near-term options on the belief that these are obvious signs that a company is a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many instances of these &quot;unusual&quot; signs in trading activity, such as occurred in First Data (FDC - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr - Rating) and Texas Utility (TXU - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr - Rating). But these transactions often occur too quickly and too close to the event for the average investor to take advantage of the &quot;tell&quot; being provided by the options market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people might find solace in knowing that the activity in both of these cases was brazen and obvious enough to get the SEC off its tuchus and launch official investigations, but that retribution does little to line our pockets or buy our babies new shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more subtle way to identify takeover candidates is to use the pricing of the LEAP options as a predictive tool for which companies investors believe are buyout targets. That is, look at the implied volatility of options across the option chain over several expiration periods with an eye toward the skew. You're watching for the implied volatility of longer-dated options to be lower than the nearer-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For equity options, the typical or normal skew has longer-dated options awarded a higher volatility than shorter-term options. Remember the connection between time and implied volatility. This also assumes there is no known upcoming event such as an earnings report or court ruling within a specific time period. Implied volatility can be viewed as the interest rate on bonds in that the longer the duration or expiration, the greater the impact a change in yield will have on the value or price of the underlying investment product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, remember that when a takeover is announced, especially a buyout that contains a significant cash portion, it will cause a steep decline in implied volatility. That means options across all time frames will basically trade at intrinsic value plus the carrying costs based on the forecasts for the probability and time frame of the deal's closing date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders have become hip to the game that IV will collapse on a buyout and have been selling calendar spreads, that is, buying near-term options and selling longer-term options for a net credit on names rumored to be buyout candidates. It is a much more conservative approach to playing the takeover game; the maximum profit is limited to the credit collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One suggestion for keeping the risk or loss to a manageable level: If a deal fails to materialize by two weeks prior to the front month's expiration, then I'd close the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance and regional financial services sectors have a number of names where the option chain displays this type of reverse skew, indicating that investors are anticipating more buyouts and consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Marsh &amp;amp; McLennan (MMC - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr - Rating) is currently trading around $32.50. You can buy the July $35 call for 60 cents per contract, which gives it an implied volatility of 31%, and simultaneously sell the January 2008 call for $1.80, which gives it an implied volatility of just 20%. That results in a net credit of $1.20 for the calendar spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to fly in the face of the standard advice to buy options that are cheap and sell the more expensive options based on their relative implied volatility. But this is a case in which one might want to interpret the price configuration or price skew as predictive; there is a good possibility that MMC will be taken over or at least receive a buyout bid. If that should occur the IV would decline and the value of the spread would flatten out. The longer-dated January 2008 options sold short would lose a substantial amount of their time premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spirit, this is what every internet forum post is like. One of the funniest things I've ever seen on the internet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could a typical young man, armed only with a knife, (say, six or eight inches long) be trained to consistently &quot;win&quot; fights with a grizzly bear? Assume no element of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes this award-winning response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime your knife will probably break. Or worse yet, get stuck. Have you ever felt bear hide? Counting in the thick fur I suspect most blows would
glance off. Remember that the bear is moving very fast. And all it needs to do
is tag you once and you're toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this counter-response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm talking serious ninja-level combat reflexes here, though. You're probably thinking of just Secret Agent level reflexes. Step it up another notch. I'm
imagining the guy is all wall-jumping off trees and doing scissor-kicks and
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ordering of adjectives in English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, there is an order in which adjectives modifying a noun are sequenced, and we all do it naturally and the same way. It is not taught in any explicit way, but if you heard an alternative ordering, you would consider it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.csmonitor.com/verbal_energy/2007/05/index.html#entry-33940428&quot;&gt;Rules no one teaches but everyone learns&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://web2.uvcs.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/grammar/adjord.htm&quot;&gt;Adjective order&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Determiner, Observation, Physical Description (Size, Shape, Age, Color), Origin, Material, Qualifier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, determiners sometimes have their own order. Here are some opinions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quantifier, Determiner, Order, Number, Intensifier&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quantifier, Article/Possessive/Demonstrative&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determiner (Articles/Demonstratives/Indefinites/Possessives), Order, Quantity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Article, Order, Number&lt;/li&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com&quot;&gt;Google books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Books is really cool. There are lots of books you can browse online. In fact, many appear to be available nearly in their entirety. I noticed it again today (2008-11-04, an update) when &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=DW2ldput788C&quot;&gt;Programming WCF Services&lt;/a&gt; appeared in my google search and I was amazed to find how much of the content was available to examine.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Python analytics</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;These use the numpy library, I believe. I adapted them to work in a more vanilla python way as I could not get my head around numpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exponential moving average&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
def ema(s, n):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    returns an n period exponential moving average for
    the time series s

    s is a list ordered from oldest (index 0) to most recent
    (index -1) n is an integer

    returns a numeric array of the exponential moving average
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    s = array(s)
    ema = []
    j = 1
    #get n sma first and calculate the next n period ema
    sma = sum(s[:n]) / n
    multiplier = 2 / float(1 + n)
    ema.append(sma)
    #EMA(current) = ( (Price(current) - EMA(prev) ) xMultiplier) + EMA(prev)
    ema.append(( (s[n] - sma) * multiplier) + sma)
    #now calculate the rest of the values
    for i in s[n+1:]:
        tmp = ( (i - ema[j]) * multiplier) + ema[j]
        j = j + 1
        ema.append(tmp)

&lt;p&gt;Simple moving average&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&quot;Better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer,&quot; says English jurist William Blackstone.&amp;nbsp; The ratio 10:1 has become known as the &quot;Blackstone ratio.&quot; Lawyers &quot;are indoctrinated&quot; with it &quot;early in law school.&quot; &quot;Schoolboys are taught&quot; it. In the fantasies of legal academics, jurors think about Blackstone routinely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm&quot;&gt;n Guilty Men&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

                <description>The annual Pop Concert was a beloved institution at Dondero High School from 1971-2006. It was directed by music instructor Rick Hartsoe for 35 years, assisted by Jan Stewart since 1983. The A Capella Choir and student instrumentalists traditionally presented 20 popular songs per concert: ten full choir pieces chosen for their harmonic and instrumental interest, and ten solos of the students' choosing. The nine soloists were student-selected via an audition process, and the top soloist each year was obliged to perform an encore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comfortstand.com/artists/dondero.html&quot;&gt;Dondero High School music&lt;/a&gt;]

                <title>Coding Horror links</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;Coding Horror links&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000743.html&quot;&gt;Is Your Database Under Version Control?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database is a critical part of your application. If you deploy version 2.0 of your application against version 1.0 of your database, what do you get? A broken application. And that's why your database should always be under source control right next to your application code. You deploy the app, and you deploy the database. Like peanut butter and chocolate, they are two great tastes that taste great together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000738.html&quot;&gt;Cool Gifts for Geeks: 2006 Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000512.html&quot;&gt;PowerPoint presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000589.html&quot;&gt;Code smells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000656.html&quot;&gt;The Last Configuration Section Handler.. Revisited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call &quot;FizzBuzz Questions&quot; named after a game children often play (or are made to play) in schools in the UK. An example of a Fizz-Buzz question is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number and for the multiples of five print &quot;Buzz&quot;. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes. Want to know something scary? The majority of comp sci graduates can't. I've also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000684.html&quot;&gt;When Understanding Means Rewriting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that developers want to rewrite everything; it's that very few developers are smart enough to understand code without rewriting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000552.html&quot;&gt;How Not To Become a Rockstar Programmer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to get better at writing code is to write code. So study &quot;good code*&quot; all you want, but write as much code as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001138.html&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Code Kata&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an important distinction [between doing your programming job and practicing programming]. I may drive to work every day, but I'm far from a professional driver. Similarly, programming every day may not be enough to make you a professional programmer. So what can turn someone into a professional driver or programmer? What do you do to practice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;S3Fox Organizer for Amazon(S3Fox) v0.4: (NEW!) This firefox extension(browser plugin) provides an user friendly interface for Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) . Its interface is very much similar to the FTP interface that lists local folders in the left panel and S3 buckets/files/folders in the right panel. Files/folders can be moved from the local computer to Amazon's storage space and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Perl</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbspot.com/News/2001/03/perl_test.html&quot;&gt;Perl experts were astounded by the results&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I was amazed that none of the students were able to read this simple sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
$_='while(read+STDIN,$_,2048){$a=29;$c=142;if((@a=unx&quot;C*&quot;,$_)
[20]&amp;amp;48){$h=5;$_=unxb24,join&quot;&quot;,@b=map{xB8,unxb8,chr($_^$a[--$h+84])}
@ARGV;s/...$/1$&amp;amp;/;$d=unxV,xb25,$_;$b=73;$e=256|(ord$b[4])&amp;lt;&amp;lt;9|ord$b[3];
$d=$d&amp;gt;&amp;gt;8^($f=($t=255)&amp;amp;($d&amp;gt;&amp;gt;12^$d&amp;gt;&amp;gt;4^$d^$d/8))&amp;lt;&amp;lt;17,$e=$e&amp;gt;&amp;gt;8^($t&amp;amp;
($g=($q=$e&amp;gt;&amp;gt;14&amp;amp;7^$e)^$q*8^$q&amp;lt;&amp;lt;6))&amp;lt;&amp;lt;9,$_=(map{$_%16or$t^=$c^=
($m=(11,10,116,100,11,122,20,100)[$_/16%8])&amp;amp;110;$t^=(72,@z=(64,72,$a^
=12*($_%16-2?0:$m&amp;amp;17)),$b^=$_%64?12:0,@z)[$_%8]}(16..271))[$_]^
(($h&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=8)+=$f+(~$g&amp;amp;$t))for@a[128..$#a]}print+x&quot;C*&quot;,@a}';s/x/pack+/g;eval&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, come on, that's so easy,&quot; said Paul Chen, Chairman of the Learn Perl or Die Association, which administered the test nationwide. &quot;Teachers need to start with simple phrases like $RF=~tr/A-Z/a-z/; and work up from there. We really need to start teaching this in first grade if kids are ever going to understand this by high school.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Log4net</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Log4net is the .NET version of log4j. In order to use it you must do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference log4net-net-1.1.dll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each class include the following&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using log4net;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;private static log4net.ILog s_log = 
  LogManager.GetLogger(
    System.Reflection.MethodBase.
    GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goto Project-&amp;gt;Add New Item-&amp;gt;Application Configuration File. This will create a file called App.Config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter log4net config info into App.Config. Here is a sample file: SampleAppConfig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In AssemblyInfo.cs add the following to the end of the file:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;[assembly: log4net.Config.DOMConfigurator(Watch=true)]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>New Year's Resolution: Avoid Traders' Top 10 Mistakes</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestreet.com/markets/activetraderupdate/10330482.html&quot;&gt;New Year's Resolution: Avoid Traders' Top 10 Mistakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year's Resolution: Become a more profitable trader.

&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving sustained success in trading requires avoiding numerous pitfalls as much as it does seeking out and executing winning trades. In fact, most professional traders will tell you that it's not any specific trading methodologies that make them successful but rather the overall rules to which they adhere that keep them &quot;in the game&quot; long enough to achieve success.

&lt;p&gt;Following are 10 of the more prevalent mistakes I believe traders make in trading stocks and other markets. This list is in no particular order of importance.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to have a trading plan in place before a trade is executed.&lt;/strong&gt; Without a specific plan, a trader does not know, among other things, when or where he will exit the trade or how much money may be made or lost. Traders with no predetermined trading plan are flying by the seat of their pants, and that's usually a recipe for a &quot;crash and burn.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inadequate trading assets or improper money management.&lt;/strong&gt; It does not take a fortune to trade the stock or futures markets successfully. Traders with less than $10,000 in their trading accounts can and do trade successfully. And traders with $50,000 or more in their trading accounts can and do lose it all in a heartbeat. Part of trading success boils down to proper money management and not gunning for those high-risk &quot;home-run&quot; type trades that involve too much capital at one time.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectations that are too high, too soon.&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning traders who expect to quit their &quot;day jobs&quot; and make a good living trading in their first few years are usually disappointed. You don't become a successful doctor or lawyer or business owner in the first couple of years of the practice. It takes hard work and perseverance to achieve success in any field of endeavor -- and trading is no different. Trading markets is not the easy, &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; scheme that a few unsavory characters make it out to be.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to use protective stops.&lt;/strong&gt; Using protective buy or sell stops upon entering a trade provide a trader with a good idea of how much money he or she is risking on that particular trade, should it turn out to be a loser. Protective stops are a good money-management tool, but they're not perfect. There are no perfect money-management tools in futures trading.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of &quot;patience&quot; and &quot;discipline.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; While these two virtues are overworked and very often mentioned when determining what unsuccessful traders lack, not many will argue with their merits. Indeed: Don't trade just for the sake of trading or just because you haven't traded for a while. Let those very good trading &quot;setups&quot; come to you, and then act upon them in a prudent way. The market will do what the market wants to do -- and nobody can force the market's hand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading against the trend -- or trying to pick tops and bottoms in markets.&lt;/strong&gt; It's human nature to want to buy low and sell high (or sell high and buy low for short-side traders). Unfortunately, that's not a proven means of making profits in futures trading. Top-pickers and bottom-pickers are usually trading against the trend, which is a major mistake.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting losing positions ride too long.&lt;/strong&gt; Most successful traders will not sit on a losing position for very long. They'll set a tight protective stop, and if it's hit, they'll take their losses (usually minimal), then move on to the next potential setup. Traders who sit on a losing trade &quot;hoping&quot; the market will soon turn in their favor are usually doomed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Overtrading.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Trading too many markets at one time is a mistake -- especially if you are racking up losses. If losses are piling up, it's time to cut back on trading, even though the temptation is to make more trades to recover the recently lost assets. It takes keen focus and concentration to be a successful futures trader. Having &quot;too many irons in the fire&quot; at one time is a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to accept complete responsibility for your actions.&lt;/strong&gt; When you have a losing trade or are in a losing streak, don't blame your broker or someone else. You are responsible for your own success or failure in trading. You make the decisions. If you feel you are not in firm control of your own trading, then why do you feel that way? You should make immediate changes that put you in firm control of your own trading destiny.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not getting a bigger-picture perspective on a market.&lt;/strong&gt; One can look at a daily bar chart and get a shorter-term perspective on a market or stock trend. But a look at the longer-term weekly or monthly chart for that same market can reveal a completely different picture. It is prudent to examine longer-term charts for that bigger-picture perspective when contemplating a trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>So you think your 401(k) money is safe</title>
                <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://ellistrust.com/news/Ellis_LATimesArticle.doc.pdf&quot;&gt;So you think your 401(k) money is safe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally a LA Times article on the lack of federal protection for 401(k) plans, the article is no longer available at latimes.com. Link to a PDF that has the original content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thefts from 401(k)s at large companies are practically unheard of. These plans generally are run by big investment firms whose reputations could be ruined by pilferage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees typically choose their investments from a menu of mutual funds and can monitor their account balances around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a much different picture at many smaller companies. The plans may be overseen by the firm's owner or business manager. Employees often have no say in how their money is invested and no way to monitor their accounts. When theft occurs, it tends to happen at companies on the edge of bankruptcy. As the firms collapse, there may not be enough assets left to repay workers or enough insurance to cover their losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life-changing knowledge does typically require advanced learning techniques. In fact, it's been said that the average adult only uses 10% of his/her brain. Imagine what we may be capable of with more advanced learning techniques. Here are 77 tips related to knowledge and learning to help you on your quest. A few are specifically for students in traditional learning institutions; the rest for self-starters, or those learning on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Division of labor</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The Economist on a theory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380326&quot;&gt;Division of Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEANDERTHAL man was a strong, large-brained, skilful big-game hunter who had survived for more than 200,000 years in the harsh European climates of the last Ice Age. But within a few thousand years of the arrival of modern humans in the continent, he was extinct. Why that happened is a matter of abiding interest to anthropologically inclined descendants of those interloping moderns. The extinction of Neanderthal man has been attributed variously to his having lower intelligence than modern humans, to worse language skills, to cruder tools, or even to the lack of a propensity for long-distance trade. The latest proposal, though, is that it is not so much Neanderthal man that was to blame, as modern woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>The New, Soft Paternalism</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;The New York Times on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03wwln_lede.html?ex=1322802000&amp;en=dc95d1be89c43ff5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;The New, Soft Paternalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if it could be shown that even highly competent,
well-informed people fail to make choices in their best interest? And
what if the government could somehow step in and nudge them in the
right direction without interfering with their liberty, or at least not
very much? Welcome to the new world of &quot;soft paternalism.&quot; The old
&quot;hard&quot; paternalism says, We know what's best for you, and we'll force
you to do it. By contrast, soft paternalism says, You know what's best
for you, and we'll help you to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example. In some
states with casino gambling, like Missouri and Michigan, compulsive
gamblers have the option of putting their names on a blacklist, or
&quot;self-exclusion&quot; list, that bars them from casinos. Once on the list,
they are banned for life. If they violate the ban, they risk being
arrested and having their winnings confiscated. In Missouri, more than
10,000 people have availed themselves of this program. In Michigan, the
first person to sign up for it was, as it happens, also the first to be
arrested for violating its terms when he couldn't resist sneaking back
to the blackjack tables; he was sentenced to a year's probation, and
the state kept his winnings of $1,223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Make bootable USB drive</title>
                <description>[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2041234,00.asp&quot;&gt;Make bootable USB drive&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do when your computer won't boot, your most recent backup is three months old, and you don't have an emergency CD? What if you're using a laptop that doesn't even have a CD drive? Kiss your data goodbye-or just whip out the bootable USB key (or thumb drive) you prepared in advance. The key will boot into a free Windows-based system called BartPE (that's Bart's Preinstalled Environment), devised by Bart Lagerweij, from which you can copy files on your hard drive to the key or, in some cases, send them over a network to another machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, not all computers can boot from all USB keys; you'll need to experiment with yours-unfortunately, there's no way to predict if it'll work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools you'll need are a USB 2.0-compatible drive with 256MB or more of storage space; a Microsoft Windows XP installation CD with Service Pack 2 (see step 1, below, if you don't have a Win XP CD with SP2); and Bart's PE -Builder, from www.nu2.nu/pebuilder. For faster booting on some but not all systems, you can try FlashBoot (20 euros, or about $25; www.primeexpert.com), which automates the process of installing the BartPE environment to a USB key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before booting from your USB key, locate your PC's BIOS settings and explore the menus to find the USB settings, or possibly the boot order settings, to add the key to the list of boot drives (write down any settings you change, in case you have to restore them later). You may need to specify that a USB key will be read as a hard drive, not a &quot;super-floppy.&quot; One important note: There's a serious security risk involved in allowing your PC to boot from a USB key-anyone with a bootable key can take advantage of the capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got SP2?&lt;br /&gt;
If your Windows XP CD includes Service Pack 2, skip this step. But if not, use AutoStreamer (www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=223562) to build a burnable CD image from your original Win XP CD with a &quot;slipstreamed&quot; SP2 file (download it from www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2; click Download and deploy SP2 to multiple computers). The Restore CD that comes with mass-market machines won't work; only an original Win XP install CD will.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Start Building&lt;br /&gt;
PE Builder builds a BartPE disk by combining files from a Win XP-with-SP2 CD with its own files. For faster building, copy your CD to a folder on your hard drive, as we've done here. Choose Create ISO image to use your USB key-of course, Burn to CD/DVD would create a bootable CD.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Select Plug-ins&lt;br /&gt;
PE Builder's plug-in dialog lists files included with the PE Builder download and others that require you to add commercial and freeware programs. You can also add network and other drivers following instructions on the PE Builder site; you may need to add drivers for network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Flashboot It&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to get BartPE on a USB key is with FlashBoot. Simply point the program at the ISO file created by PE Builder, select Convert BartPE Bootable Disk to Bootable Flash Disk, and let FlashBoot do the work. If the resulting USB key doesn't work, a slower-booting method may work instead. For details, see www.911cd.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=10806.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Start It Up&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like the first screen you see when Windows XP starts up, but it's BartPE booting from a USB key.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;That Should Be It. . .&lt;br /&gt;
If all goes well, and you choose to start the network, BartPE will use DHCP to configure your network client automatically. If that doesn't work, move on to step 7.&lt;/li&gt;
 
&lt;li&gt;. . . But if Not&lt;br /&gt;
You may need to configure your network hardware manually. It's not difficult if you've ever dealt with network settings. You'll probably need to know the name of your network and the IP numbers of your router and any other networked machine that you want to access. But you don't really need a network, because you can save files directly to the USB key for retrieval from another machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious courtroom exchanges. Sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: No.&lt;br /&gt;
ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: No.&lt;br /&gt;
ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: No.&lt;br /&gt;
ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: No.&lt;br /&gt;
ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;
ATTORNEY: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?&lt;br /&gt;
WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Cut Losses Quickly To Preserve Your Cash</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1100&amp;status=article&amp;id=247359197734981&quot;&gt;Cut Losses Quickly To Preserve Your Cash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[...]Investors holding on in hopes of a quick turnaround should remember the cardinal rule of CAN SLIM investing: Always sell when a stock drops 7% or 8% below your purchase price. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why sell so quickly? So you can survive to invest another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting capital should top every investor's priority list. It takes discipline, particularly when you've worked hard to research a stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to ride out a loss in the hopes of making your money back. But market history is rich with examples of stocks that crushed portfolios when investors failed to cut losses quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>What do an investor, a trader and a gambler have in common?</title>
                <description>What do an investor, a trader and a gambler have in common? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/editorials/wagner/2006/1030.html&quot;&gt;Hans Wagner&lt;/a&gt; argues that an investor, trader, and gambler are similar because they have rules they operate by. I'd like to say there is a larger similarity, perhaps in the content of the rules, but Wagner is not making that claim as fas as I can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important elements are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;money management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;conserving capital / cutting losses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the importance of temperament / personality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;finding good trades&lt;br /&gt;Fundamentals agree with technicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Trailing Stop Techniques</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The article outlines the basic use of trailing stops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most basic technique for establishing an appropriate exit point is the trailing-stop technique. Very simply, the trailing stop maintains a stop-loss order at a precise percentage below the market price (or above, in the case of a short position). The stop-loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price, always maintaining the same percentage below (or above) the market price. The trader is then &quot;guaranteed&quot; to know the exact minimum profit that his or her position will garner. This level of profitability the trader will have previously determined based on his or her predilection toward
aggressive or conservative trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then describes methods of determining where to set the stop.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Credit-Default Swap Traders Anticipated Announcements of LBOs</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The money sentence: &quot;The swaps themselves have become a research tool for analysts who
monitor their trading activity as a means of keeping abreast of possible pending deals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://seekingalpha.com/article/19463-credit-default-swap-traders-profiting-from-inside-info-on-lbos&quot;&gt;SeekingAlpha&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;amp;sid=aqmJW3Bshrq4&amp;amp;refer=home&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Credit Derivatives Research LLC, a New York-based independent research group, contends in a recent study that derivatives traders may be profiting from inside information on leveraged buyouts. The tip-off was the rise -- prior to the public announcement of any deals -- of credit-default swaps based on the bonds of 30 takeover targets in 2006, including four of the year's five biggest LBOs. &quot;Evidence shows that CDS prices are widening before public rumor or news,&quot; said Tim Backshall, a strategist at Credit Derivatives Research. &quot;Whether it's insider trading or more informed selling is unclear.&quot; Credit-default swaps are contracts derived from bonds and loans that are used to speculate on a company's ability to repay debt. They were designed ostensibly to protect bondholders from default -- they will pay the holder face value in exchange for the underlying securities if the company fails to pay its debts -- but they have proven very attractive to speculators, since they are less expensive and more liquid than corporate bonds. Since their invention less than a decade ago, the total face value of CDS contracts worldwide has reached $26 trillion -- a faster growth rate than any other derivative. The study notes that in 2005, the cost of credit-default swaps on $10 million of Knight Ridder bonds surged 35% one day before the company's largest shareholder called for a sale in an SEC filing. Credit-default swaps on $10 million of HCA Inc. bonds rose 48% in 2 1/2 months before news broke that the hospital operator was in talks for what has turned out to be a $33 billion LBO. And the week before the New York Times reported on Sept. 11 that Freescale Semiconductor may be sold for $16 billion to an investor group, credit-default swaps based on the company's bonds rose 11%. CDS traders are essentially unregulated: neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] claims responsibility for their actions. The swaps themselves have become a research tool for analysts who monitor their trading activity as a means of keeping abreast of possible pending deals.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>RIO 25 Sep 2006&lt;br /&gt;
Hit low on a hammer with high trade and reversed the next day.&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a signal that indicates a broad reversal started that day?

                <title>The Ultimate Mystery: Popular Sport Beats SATs at Ranking Universities Academically</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/8/prweb431459.htm&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Mystery: Popular Sport Beats SATs at Ranking Universities Academically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether measured by graduation rate or prestigious scholarships -- the result is the same. What is this sport that mysteriously divines a university's stature so precisely? It's called Ultimate Frisbee, or more commonly just Ultimate. It is the fastest growing college sport and is already played interscholastically at over 500 colleges and universities. While wildly popular on campuses, relatively few in the wider world have even heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study (slated for release September 1) by Dr. Michael Norden shows that among all 86 private national universities, those ranking in the top half for Ultimate have a graduation rate of over 85%, while those in the bottom half graduate just 60%. The difference in the totals of Rhodes scholars and Marshall scholars among their graduates during this decade is even more dramatic - 208 versus 15. (The odds of this happening by chance are truly infinitesimal). Moreover, the top ten schools based on Ultimate ranking have a slightly higher mean graduation rate and more winners of top scholarships than schools chosen by - not only SATs, but any standard metric including: grades, faculty resources, and financial resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 1: Keep It a Trade&lt;br /&gt;
In this special look at Jim Cramer's latest book, he lays out a brutal, but effective, rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 2: First Loss Is Best&lt;br /&gt;
Why you should leave a trade that doesn't work immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 3: Take Your Losses&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer clears up a common, and costly, trading misconception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 4: Trading Gains, Not Investment Losses&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer describes a slippery slope for traders and how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 5: Tips Are for Waiters&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer points out why tips are best left on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 6: No Sale? No Profit&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer lays out why you have to take gains, especially now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 7: Control Your Losses&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer shows an easy way to improve your returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 8: Don't Fear That You'll Miss Anything&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer points out a reason to control this impulse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 9: Don't Trade Off Only the Headlines&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer points out the reason to resist the knee-jerk reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commandment No. 10: Don't Trade Flow&lt;br /&gt;
Cramer warns that the tape reveals sucker plays, not good trades.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Our resident law geek Stewart Rutledge writes in with a handy Gmail tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sending a message, type the name of the recipient you want to appear in your Contacts and then place the email address inside &amp;lt;&amp;gt;. That will auto-add the name to your address book formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, rather than: stewart@example.com in the To: box, use Master Stewart Rutledge, the Wonderful &amp;lt;stewart@example.com&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, this method seems to work in most email clients (Thunderbird, at least) that auto-add recipients to your address book. Thanks, Stewart! �?&quot; Gina Trapani&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Overtrading</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A common mistake for stock market investors is overtrading. Learning to sit and wait is one of the biggest challenges for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore, one of the world's greatest investors, said: &quot;It is never your thinking that makes big money. It's the sitting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks stair-step their way higher by breaking out of basing patterns, running up and then forming new bases from which they break out. Savvy investors learn how to hang on to leading stocks that go through normal pullbacks rather than sell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning investors are often shaken out of winning stocks because they buy incorrectly. You can avoid that by buying a stock within 5% of its buy point in a sound base. Studies of past winners show that stocks breaking out of sound bases on heavy volume rarely retreat more than 8% from the proper buy point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So buying right will let you sit longer with winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Shannon on when to sell a position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are seven events that should motivate you to sell. These events can be best described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial Protective Stop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaps against the prevailing trend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Price Targets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard Trailing Stops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RealTick &amp;174; Trailing Stops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moving Average Crossovers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time Stops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_oh_to_be.html&quot;&gt;Real Crime, Fake Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the last 40 years, government policy in Britain, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; if not always &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt;, has been to render the British population virtually defenseless against criminals and criminality. Almost alone of British government policies, this one has been supremely effective: no Briton nowadays goes many hours without wondering how to avoid being victimized by a criminal intent on theft, burglary, or violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UnmanagedType.LPArray&lt;br /&gt;
A pointer to the first element of a C-style array. When marshaling from managed to unmanaged, the length of the array is determined by the length of the managed array. When marshaling from unmanaged to managed, the length of the array is determined from the MarshalAsAttribute.SizeConst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UnmanagedType.LPStruct&lt;br /&gt;
A pointer to a C-style structure that you use to marshal managed formatted classes. Valid for platform invoke methods only.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-08-06: Alexander Elder also has a service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elder.com/spike.html&quot;&gt;Spike Spectators' Group&lt;/a&gt; which allows investors and traders to subscribe to other traders' stock picks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Traders often ask: 'How do you find stocks to trade?'
Many pros spend hours each week scanning databases, looking for attractive candidates. This is similar to mining - tunneling through thick layers of useless rock to find a relatively small quantity of rich ore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This homework is essential for successful trading, but it takes a great deal of time and energy. Now, for a relatively small fee, you can have rich ore delivered to you. You can have a steady flow of intelligent picks from a group of professional and semi-professional traders, each of whom spends hours looking for stocks and most of whom trade their own and their colleagues' picks. Now, instead of looking for stocks, you can review more than a dozen attractive picks each week to see which of them work best with your own trading system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50 three week trial / $390 per quarter / $1170 per year&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Interviewing candidates</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Technical topics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent processing (deadlocks, semaphores, mutexes, race conditions.etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compilation (e.g tell me how one works)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory management (garbage collection, dynamic memory allocation.etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language comparisons (e.g Java vs. C#)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data structures (e.g what data structure would be most appropriate for .)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms (e.g. searching.etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object orientation (polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, overloading..etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPC (tcp/ip, udp, shared mem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask questions based on what the candidate can tell me in detail about the work they have done. I always get them to tell me &quot;how&quot; they did a project, and to avoid lingering on &quot;what&quot; it did. Once the architecture is revealed, I ask questions about it - like &quot;Why did you do it that way when it would have been better to do it some other way (giving an alternative)?&quot;. I always ask the candidate to sell themselves on 2 or 3 pieces of work which most closely represent how able they are as a programmer. Then I ask them to justify it. It's normally pretty clear in a short space of time whether they are a serious programmer or just a hobbyist working on the peripherals of someone elses work. The main problem is getting to stop telling me what the application does and focus on how they solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>NasdaqTrader's selection process</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nasdaqtrader.blogspot.com/2006/04/my-stock-picking-process.html&quot;&gt;NasdaqTrader's selection process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I receive more emails and comments about this topic then almost anything else, so I decided to lay a bunch of it out. This is the basics of my stock picking process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the trend of the market, is it up, down, or sideways. Always determine that first. Learned from the great Jesse Livermore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the strongest sectors or weakest depending on the trend of the markets. When you are trying to decide what stocks to be in during bull phases or bear phases go where the action is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you identify the best target sectors now drill down and find the best stocks. This is where the charts come into play. Look for the best looking charts in a strong or weak sector depending on market conditions. Now for the really good stuff, I will list the keys to finding the silver bullet in stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving averages. The first thing I look at is the simple moving averages. I use a few different time frames for this. I do this to identify if the stock is trending with the market/sector or against it. Is the stock strong i.e. above the 50/200 sma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then look for trendline patterns. Is the stock above major trendlines or below it. Is there any pattern that I can easily see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume patterns is next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stochastic patterns for entry and exit points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love stocks with small floats. Supply will out strip demand when things go your way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am looking to go long short interest on the stock is vital. Short interest is fuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market psychology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only touching on this stuff briefly but I hope it gives my readers some insight into what I do when looking for stocks. Good luck trading.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Jokes about communism</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7412&quot;&gt;Jokes about communism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Communism is the only political system to have created its own international brand of comedy. The standard interpretation is that communist jokes were a form of resistance. But they were also a safety valve for the regimes and jokes were told by the rulers as well as the rule -- even Stalin told some good ones.&lt;br /&gt;

Detours is a library for instrumenting arbitrary Win32 functions on x86, x64, and IA64 machines. Detours intercepts Win32 functions by re-writing the in-memory code for target functions. The Detours package also contains utilities to attach arbitrary DLLs and data segments (called payloads) to any Win32 binary.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Nearly everyone is in favor of critical thinking. This is evidence that the term is in danger of becoming meaningless. Skeptics should spearhead the effort to clarify what critical thinking is-and what it is not. The stakes are high.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>RSI formula simplified</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've seen the RSI formula many times but never seen this algebraic simplification that makes the measure intuitive.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;Substitute y = U / D
 
RSI = 100 - [100 / [ 1 + y] ]
RSI = 100 * [1 - 1 / [ 1 + y] ] (factor out 100)
RSI = 100 * [1 + y - 1] / [ 1 + y] (common denom of &lt;em&gt;1 + y&lt;/em&gt;)
RSI = 100 * y / [ 1 + y] (reduce)
RSI = 100 * [U / D] / [ 1 + U / D] (substitute y)
RSI = 100 * [U / D] / [ [D + U] / D] (common denom)
RSI = 100 * U / [D + U] (elim div by &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esignallearning.com/education/resources/atoz/rsi.asp&quot;&gt;esignallearning.com&lt;/a&gt; comments on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The RSI is a fairly simple formula, but is difficult to explain without pages of examples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is not so. RSI is the ratio of up-moves to the sum of all moves scaled onto the range 0 to 100. That's really simple to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggest using SQL Server Reporting Services and authoring all you reports in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/reporting/rdlspec.mspx&quot;&gt;RDL format&lt;/a&gt;. Then, if you don't like how SSRS is working, or don't like the licensing, you can pop over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fyireporting.com/&quot;&gt;FYIReporting&lt;/a&gt; and get their open-source version and is RDL compliant...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Return of the Whorf hypothesis</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kanajlo.spaces.live.com/?_c11_BlogPart_BlogPart=blogview&amp;_c=BlogPart&amp;partqs=amonth%3D5%26ayear%3D2006&quot;&gt;Living without Numbers or Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually Everett came up with a surprising explanation for the peculiarities of the Piraha idiom. &quot;The language is created by the culture,&quot; says the linguist. He explains the core of Piraha culture with a simple formula: &quot;Live here and now.&quot; The only thing of importance that is worth communicating to others is what is being experienced at that very moment. &quot;All experience is anchored in the present,&quot; says Everett, who believes this carpe-diem culture doesn't allow for abstract thought or complicated connections to the past -- limiting the language accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/unlocking-the-secret-sounds-of-language-life-without-time-or-numbers-477061.html&quot;&gt;Unlocking the secret sounds of language: Life without time or number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their culture's ingrained emphasis on referring only to immediate, personal experiences, the tribesmen do not have words for any abstract concept, from colour to memory and even to numbers. There is no past tense, he says, because everything exists for them in the present. When it can no longer be perceived, it ceases, to all intents, to exist. &quot;In many ways, the Piraha are the ultimate empiricists,&quot; Professor Everett says. &quot;They demand evidence for everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life, for the Piraha, is about seizing the moment and taking pleasure here and now. &quot;I suddenly noticed how excited they were whenever planes crossed the sky then disappeared. They just love sitting around watching people coming around the bend in the jungle. Whenever I came into the village then left, they were amazed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestreet.com/_kirk/markets/activetraderupdate/10278406.html&quot;&gt;Tenets of Investing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure where this article originally came from I've used a current live link, but I don't think it is the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://extraordinaryprofits.blogspot.com/2007/03/master-investor.html&quot;&gt;Master investor rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Believes the first priority is preservation of capital.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a result, is risk-averse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has developed his own investment philosophy, which is an expression of his personality. As a result, no two highly successful investors have the same approach.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has developed his own personal system for selecting, buying and selling investments.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Believes diversification is for the birds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hates to pay taxes, and arranges his affairs to legally minimise his tax bill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Only invests in what he understands.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Refuses to make investments that do not meet his criteria. Can effortlessly say 'no'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is continually searching for new investment opportunities that meet his criteria and actively engages in his own research.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has the patience to wait until he finds the right investment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts instantly when he has made a decision.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Holds a winning investment until a pre-determined reason to exit arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follows his own system religiously.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is aware of his own fallibility. Corrects mistakes the moment they arise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Always treats mistakes as learning experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As his experience increases, so do his returns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Almost never talks to anyone about what he's doing. Not interested in what others think of his investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has successfully delegated most, if not all, of his responsibilities to others.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lives far below his means.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does what he does for stimulation and self-fulfilment - not for money.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is emotionally involved with the process of investing; but can walk away from any individual investment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lives and breathes investing, 24 hours a day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Puts his money where his mouth is. For example, Warren Buffet has 99 per cent of his net worth in shares of Berkshire Hathaway; George Soros, similarly, keeps most of his money in his Quantum Fund. For both, the destiny of their personal wealth is identical to that of the people who have entrusted money to their management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Student Academic Services at California Polytechnic have an interesting article on procrastination, discussing why we do it, how it affects us, and what we can gain from overcoming our procrastinating tendencies. They also offer a simple four-step cure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Realize you are delaying something unnecessarily. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover the real reasons for your delay. List them. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dispute those real reasons and overcome them. Be vigorous. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Begin the task. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy quip</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Prosser said, &quot;You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Appropriate time?&quot; hooted Arthur. &quot;Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no, he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the plans were on display...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's the display department.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With a flashlight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So had the stairs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But look, you found the notice, didn't you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;yes I did. It was on display on the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Every so often, someone on the newsgroup asks about something which doesn't exist in the framework, but which I think should. Sometimes, I'll write some code for them to plug the gap. Just occasionally, I'll tidy up the code, add XML documentation comments etc, and include it in my miscellaneous utility library. This library will, of course, grow over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Due to the nature of the library, some of the code may not have been particularly rigorously tested. You are strongly advised to give it a thorough testing before including it in any important code. Note: as of November 2006, I'm gradually adding unit tests, so the quality should improve significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html&quot;&gt;Fire and motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I was an Israeli paratrooper a general stopped by to give us a little speech about strategy. In infantry battles, he told us, there is only one strategy: Fire and Motion. You move towards the enemy while firing your weapon. The firing forces him to keep his head down so he can't fire at you. (That's what the soldiers mean when they shout &quot;cover me.&quot; It means, &quot;fire at our enemy so he has to duck and can't fire at me while I run across this street, here.&quot; It works.)  The motion allows you to conquer territory and get closer to your enemy, where your shots are much more likely to hit their target. If you're not moving, the enemy gets to decide what happens, which is not a good thing. If you're not firing, the enemy will fire at you, pinning you down.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Automatic user name and password authentication at HTML websites</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;HDB: This is lifted from some newsgroup. I can't remember where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would depend on how authentication is implemented on that site.  If it
is a custom authentication scheme you'll probably have to POST the
username and password to a &quot;login&quot; page then keep track of a session
variable to use on every subsequent Navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's http authentication then you could pass the username and password
in the URI: http://username:password@host/file.htm.  Which can be done
easily with the UriBuilder class.  But, that's slowly becoming deprecated
for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, with HTTP basic authentication, you just pass an added HTTP
header entry for the username and password (encoded in base64), which can
be done with a couple of the WebBrowser.Navigate overrides.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
String base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(ASCIIEncoding.
  ASCII.GetBytes(&quot;username:password&quot;));
String auth = String.Format(
  &quot;Authorization: Basic {0}\r\n&quot;,
  base64);
byte[] post = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
  auth.ToCharArray());
String targetFrameName = &quot;&quot;;
byte[] postData = null;
Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;http://www.contoso.com/&quot;);
webBrowser1.Navigate(uri, targetFrameName, postData, auth);&lt;/pre&gt;

                <title>Cramer's 25 Rules for Investing</title>
                <description>[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestreet.com/_tscnav/tsc/cramerbook&quot;&gt;Cramer's 25 Rules for Investing&lt;/a&gt;]

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 1: Bulls, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered&lt;br /&gt;
It's essential for all traders to know when to take some off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 2: It's OK to Pay the Taxes&lt;br /&gt;
Stop fearing the tax man and start fearing the loss man because gains can be fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 3: Don't Buy All at Once&lt;br /&gt;
To maximize your profits, stage your buys, work your orders and try to get the best price over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 4: Buy Damaged Stocks, Not Damaged Companies&lt;br /&gt;
There are no refunds on Wall Street, so do your research and focus your trades on damaged stocks rather than companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 5: Diversify to Control Risk&lt;br /&gt;
If you control the downside and diversify your holdings, the upside will take care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 6: Do Your Stock Homework&lt;br /&gt;
Before you buy any stock, it's important to research all aspects of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 7: No One Made a Dime by Panicking&lt;br /&gt;
There will always be a better time to leave the table, so it is best to avoid the fleeing masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 8: Buy Best-of-Breed Companies&lt;br /&gt;
Investing in the more expensive stock is invariably worth it because you get piece of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 9: Defend Some Stocks, Not All&lt;br /&gt;
When trading gets tough, pick your favorite stocks and defend only those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 10: Bad Buys Won't Become Takeovers&lt;br /&gt;
Bad companies never get bids, so it's the good fundamentals you need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 11: Don't Own Too Many Names&lt;br /&gt;
It can be constraining, but it's better to have a few positions you know well and like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 12: Cash Is for Winners&lt;br /&gt;
If you don't like the market or have anything compelling to buy, it's never wrong to go with cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 13: No Woulda, Shoulda, Couldas&lt;br /&gt;
This damaging emotion is destructive to the positive mindset needed to make investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 14: Expect, Don't Fear Corrections&lt;br /&gt;
It is not always clear when a correction will strike, so expect and be prepared for one at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 15: Don't Forget Bonds&lt;br /&gt;
It's important to watch more than stocks, and bonds are stocks' direct competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 16: Never Subsidize Losers With Winners&lt;br /&gt;
Any trader stuck in this position would do well to sell sinking stocks and wait a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 17: Check Hope at the Door&lt;br /&gt;
Hope is emotion, pure and simple, and trading is not a game of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 18: Be Flexible&lt;br /&gt;
Recognize and be open to the unexpected shifts in the market because business, by nature, is dynamic, not static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 19: When the Chiefs Retreat, So Should You&lt;br /&gt;
High-level executives don't quit a company for personal reasons, so that is a sign something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 20: Giving Up on Value Is a Sin&lt;br /&gt;
If you don't have patience, think about letting someone who does run your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 21: Be a TV Critic&lt;br /&gt;
Accept that what you hear on television is probably right, but no more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 22: Wait 30 Days After Preannouncements&lt;br /&gt;
Preannouncements signal ongoing weakness, wait 30 days to see if anything has gotten better before you pull the trigger to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 23: Beware of Wall Street Hype&lt;br /&gt;
Never underestimate the promotion machine because analysts get behind stocks and can keep them propelled in an up direction well beyond reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 24: Explain Your Picks&lt;br /&gt;
Buying stocks is a solitary event, too solitary in fact, so always make sure you can articulate your reasoning to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule No. 25: There's Always a Bull Market&lt;br /&gt;
It's OK if you have to work hard to find it, just don't default to what's in bear mode because you are time-constrained or intellectually lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Folder Size</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foldersize.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Folder Size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folder Size is an open source software that adds the ability to sort folders by size in Windows Explorer. Folder Size for Windows adds a new column to the Details view in Windows Explorer. The new column shows not only the size of files, but also the size of folders. It keeps track of which folders you view, and scans them in the background so you can see complete size of all files within the folder. It's very useful for cleaning up your disk. Once you get used to having that information available, a directory listing simply looks incomplete without it!&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>A duck went into a bar ...</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A duck went into a bar one day and asked the barkeeper for some grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't have any grapes,&quot; the barkeep replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day the duck waltzes in again, hops up on a stool and asks, &quot;Got any grapes?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have no grapes,&quot; the barman shouts, &quot;This is a bar, not a grocery store.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day the duck arrives at the bar again and repeats the same question. &quot;Got any grapes?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the last time,&quot; the barman roars: &quot;I have no grapes and if you come back in here again asking the same stupid question, I'll nail your @#$!! feet to the counter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day four and the duck saunters into the bar. &quot;Got a hammer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;NO!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Got any nails?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;NO!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Got any grapes?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Information on investing in Iceland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaupthing.net/?PageID=2559&quot;&gt;Kaupthing Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sjodir.kaupthing.is/template25.asp?pageid=1568&quot;&gt;Dead page that redirects to Kaupthing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-10-08: Iceland was the hot place to invest/speculate in 2005 and 2006. Now, not so much. Aggressive investment bank actions have taken the country to the brink of bankruptcy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601083&amp;sid=abjzC1zbw8VI&amp;refer=currency&quot;&gt;Iceland's Krona Falls as Central Bank Abandons One-Day Old Peg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stockmarketfunding.blogspot.com/2008/10/icelands-krona-quoted-95-below-peg.html&quot;&gt;Iceland's krona quoted 95% below peg; regulator steps in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2008-12-04: &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/magazines/fortune/iceland_gumbel.fortune/index.htm?section=money_latest&quot;&gt;Iceland: The country that became a hedge fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iceland had one of the richest economies in Europe, but it had a problem. Its three main private sector banks had become so large that their assets amounted to more than ten times the gross domestic product of the country - and there were signs that they might run into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Call .NET component from VBScript</title>
                <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a C# class library.&lt;br /&gt;
Project properties, Build tab, check the &quot;Register for COM interop&quot; checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Write your class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add [ComVisible(true)] to your class declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a VBScript to instantiate and call the object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace TestComObject
{
  [ComVisible(true)]
  public class Class1
  {
    public void Greet()
    {
      MessageBox.Show(&quot;Hello world&quot;);

&lt;blockquote class='quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more women are putting off having children until their 30s and 40s. Yet a growing body of research shows that female fertility begins to decline rapidly in the mid-30s -- leaving some women with a difficult choice: bearing children earlier or risking infertility later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle Choices, a firm based in Sheffield, U.K., has begun selling a consumer test that it claims will help women make this important decision. The test, which went on the market last month, assesses the number of eggs that a woman has left in her ovaries, by measuring three different hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gladwell offers optimism through demystification: to understand how things work is to have control over them.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>See Only Evil</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chronogram.com/issue/2006/02/news/index.php&quot;&gt;See Only Evil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author interviews CIA agent whose memoir was the basis for the film, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/&quot;&gt;Syriana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Baer's memoir, &lt;em&gt;See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War Against Terrorism&lt;/em&gt; (Crown Publishers, 2002), that Syriana is based upon. Baer served mostly in the Middle East--Beirut, Lebanon and Iraq--as well as in Sudan, Morocco, and one tour in Paris. His job was to &quot;run agents or sources across the Middle East gathering Intelligence.&quot; An Arabic speaker, he was considered one of the best on-the-ground field officers in the Middle East. In &lt;em&gt;See No Evil&lt;/em&gt;, Baer says that there is evidence linking Iran to attacks on American interests, including the Khobar Towers bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 US soldiers in 1996. He says that Iran has been mishandled by US diplomats since the 1980s, and that American foreign policy regarding the Islamic Republic is based on myths and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing else available like it that covers so much territory about the basics of starting and running a small software company. Just buy it and read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Warfield, asharewarelife.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micro-independent software vendors, or micro-ISVs, have become both a major source of applications and a realistic career alternative for IT professionals. As for the latterare you a programmer and curious about being your own boss? Where do you turn for information? Until now, online and traditional literature havent caught up with the reality of the post-dot.com bust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality explains what works and why in todays emerging micro-ISV sector. Currently, thousands of programmers build and deliver great solutions ISV-style, earning success and revenues much larger than you might guess. Written by and for micro-ISVs, with help from some of the leaders of the fieldthis book takes you beyond just daydreaming to running your own business. It thoroughly explores how it is indeed possible to launch and maintain a small and successful ISV business, and is an ideal read if youre interested in getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we recognize that you are busy and that the reason you visit a Web site like the Script Center is because you don't really have the time to learn WMI, let alone sit down and write a WMI script. And that's why we created Scriptomatic. As long as you can accept a few limitations, Scriptomatic will write your WMI scripts for you. It will even wash your car, wax your floors, and slice and dice vegetables!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, okay. But it does write your WMI scripts for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RunScript takes care of all the hard work. Basically, the following steps occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The script file is read in, if the line includes a #using, #import, or #target directive, then it is skipped, and these are explained below.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &quot;Compiler&quot; will insert using statements at the beginning of the source file and reference the necessary assemblies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &quot;Compiler&quot; will then create a namespace, a class, and possibly a Main routine to encapsulate the script.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It will then decide whether Main was declared with or without the command-line arguments option and invoke the appropriate method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/tm/050929/13231.html&quot;&gt;Trading Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy has 4 rules, yet it has been correct in the 80% range over the past decade. Here are the rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 is trading above its 200-day simple moving average.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Today, it trades (intra-day) at a 10-day low.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Today the VIX closes 5% or more above its 10-day simple moving average.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy the S&amp;amp;P 500 on the close and exit when it closes above its 10-period simple moving average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Hookie awards</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/opinion/25brooks.html&quot;&gt;Hookie awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/opinion/28brooks.html&quot;&gt;Hookie awards, Part II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people say that the age of the public intellectuals is over, that there are no longer many grand thinkers like Lionel Trilling or Reinhold Niebuhr, writing ambitious essays for the educated reader. It's true that there are fewer philosophes writing about the nature and destiny of man, but there are still hundreds of amazing essays written every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In celebration of that fact, and in case you're looking for some mind-expanding holiday reading, I've decided to create the Hookie Awards. Named after the great public intellectual Sidney Hook, they go to the authors of some of the most important essays written in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Festivus: the holiday for the rest of us</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/fashion/19FEST.html?ei=5088&amp;en=9e604923cf65dfec&amp;ex=1261198800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=&quot;&gt;Festivus: the holiday for the rest of us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those two rituals -- accusing others of being a disappointment and wrestling -- are traditions of Festivus as explained on the show by the character Frank Costanza. On that episode he tells Kramer that he invented the holiday when his children were young and he found himself in a department store tug of war with another Christmas shopper over a doll. &quot;I realized there had to be a better way,&quot; Frank says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he coined the slogan &quot;A Festivus for the rest of us&quot; and formulated the other rules: the holiday occurs on Dec. 23, features a bare aluminum pole instead of a tree and does not end until the head of the family is wrestled to the floor and pinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Process Explorer</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4614d29f-f55d-4cf3-b75f-a7e255fd1fc4&quot;&gt;Process Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class='quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've long since replaced the venerable Task Manager with Process Explorer from SysInternals. It's just better in every way - from the fact that it will show you which process created which other processes to the fact that the column names actually mean something. But today I found out how truly cool it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My machine was thrashing on something, the CPU at nearly 100%. When I fired up Process Explorer, I could see that it was the mysterious System process. If I'd been using Task Manager, that would have been pretty much all I could tell. But with Process Explorer, I was able to right-click, bring up properties, and see that one particular thread was the offender. Further, I was able to see the call stack for that thread. On top of that, I was able to click a button to pull up details of the device driver that was using the CPU so heavily. 
Love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743250605&quot;&gt;The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine, the original Berserkers were &quot;savage Norse soldiers&quot; of the Middle Ages who went into battle stark naked! Or consider the Etruscan habit of writing in &quot;boustrophedon style.&quot; Intrigued? Well, either hunker down with your own &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/em&gt;, or buy Esquire editor Jacobs's memoir of the year he spent reading all 32 volumes of the 2002 edition--that's 33,000 pages with some 44 million words. Jacobs set out on this delightfully eccentric endeavor attempting to become the &quot;smartest person in the world,&quot; although he agrees smart doesn't mean wise. Apart from the sheer pleasure of scaling a major intellectual mountain, Jacobs figured reading the encyclopedia from beginning to end would fill some gaps in his formal education and greatly increase his &quot;quirkiness factor.&quot; Reading alphabetically through whole topics he never knew existed meant he'd accumulate huge quantities of trivia to insert into conversations with unsuspecting victims. As his wife shunned him and cocktail party guests edged away, Jacobs started testing his knowledge in a hilarious series of humiliating adventures: hobnobbing at Mensa meetings, shuffling off to chess houses, trying out for the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, visiting his old prep school, even competing on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Indeed, one of the book's strongest parts is its laugh-out-loud humor. Jacobs's ability to juxtapose his quirky, sardonic wit with oddball trivia make this one of the season's most unusual books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever copied some text from a web page or a document and then wanted to paste it as simple text into another application without getting all the formatting from the original source? PureText makes this simple by adding a new Windows hot-key (default is WINDOWS+V) that allows you to paste text to any application without formatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>How to fast track your career</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slackermanager.com/slacker_manager/2005/09/fast_track_your.html&quot;&gt;How to fast track your career&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many big organizations have &quot;fast track&quot; programs. When someone is selected to be a fast tracker, it usually means that the person is recognized as being a &quot;high potential&quot; person within the organization. With fast track/HiPo designation comes a variety of positions, often spanning the scope of the business, within a relatively short period of time. Relatively short means a few years rather than a few decades. Being a fast tracker isn't a cake walk. Candidates are often given serious challenges within the organization, to see how they can perform. The payoff, of course, is increased responsibility and increased compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most organizations don't have formalized fast track programs. Sure, you may stumble upon a gracious mentor who can give you a leg up now and then but, on the whole, you're on your own. No fear, though. There are plenty of opportunities to fast track yourself. No need to talk about it-in fact, it's better that you don't talk about your plans until you've racked up at least a couple of successes. Until then, talk like that just makes other people nervous and more likely to try and subvert your plans. So mum's the word for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Bargain/coupon sites</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Often when you buy some product or service online you will notice that there is a place to enter a discount coupon. These sites advertise these coupon identifiers that you can enter on such sites to save you money. I saved a lot at dell.com by using such a coupon and I've seen coupons for airfares (even though I haven't seen one yet that I could use). Now I always check the internet for discount coupons to use. It's that important.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I'm Very Interested In Hearing Some Half-Baked Theories</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/content/node/42384&quot;&gt;I'm Very Interested In Hearing Some Half-Baked Theories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an ill-informed pseudo-intellectual with a particular interest in the unverifiable, I'm always on the lookout for some partially thought out misinformation. So, if you have an uninformed solution to a dilemma that doesn't actually exist, don't bother double-checking your information. I'm all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I must warn you: If you want to convince me of anything, you better be prepared to back up your claims with rumor, circumstantial evidence, or hard-to-make-out photographic proof. I may also need friend-of-a-friend corroboration or several signed testimonials all written in the same unmistakably spidery handwriting. I'm a quasi-critical-thinker. Things have to add up more or less in my head before I let myself be taken in by some baloney story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Atlantis, for example. When I first heard about this lost civilization, I was suspicious to say the least. But then someone made a good point: Prove that it didn't exist. I was hard-pressed to find a comeback to that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Atlantis really did exist, then where did it go? It couldn't have just disappeared without an unreasonable explanation. I was about to give up on the whole matter when suddenly it hit me: It probably washed away, and it's too deep underwater for scientists to find it. All it takes is a little supposition mixed with critical theorizing and you can easily stumble on a tenuous half-truth that really makes you think. &lt;/p&gt;[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
This is a really cool device for reducing stress. It's a biofeedback device that trains you to control your heart rate and breathing. I got one for the wife and she sleeps better when she uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2008-09-03: There is a writeup on the Stress Eraser at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003013.php&quot;&gt;Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite websites.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Setting software priorities</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SetYourPriorities.html&quot;&gt;Joel on setting software priorities&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back on the topic of choosing features for FogBugz 5.0. Here's how we got our initial prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I took a stack of 5x8 cards, and wrote a feature on each one. Then I called the team together. In my experience this works with up to about twenty people, and it's a good idea to get as many different perspectives in the room: programmers, designers, people who talk to customers, sales, management, documentation writers and testers, even (!) customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked everyone to bring their own list of feature ideas to the meeting, too. The first part of the meeting was going over each feature very, very quickly and making sure we had a very, very rough common understanding of what the feature was, and that each feature had a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, the idea was not to debate any feature on its merits, or to design the feature, or even to discuss the feature: just to have a vague, rough idea of what it was. Some of the features for FogBugz 5.0 were things like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Personalizable Home Page&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Painless Software Schedules&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Track Billable Time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fork a bug&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(46 others...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very vague stuff. Remember we didn't need to know at this point how each feature would be implemented, or what it involved, because our only goal was getting a rough prioritization that could be used as the basis to start development. This got us a list of about 50 big features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part two, we went through all of the features and everybody voted on each feature: just a quick &quot;thumbs up&quot; or &quot;thumbs down.&quot; No discussion, no nothing: just a real quick thumbs up or thumbs down on each feature. This revealed that about 14 of the feature ideas didn't have much support. I threw out all the features that only got one or two votes, leaving us with 36 potential features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated Generic PhotographNext we assigned costs for each of these features, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 was a quicky feature and 10 was a big monster feature. Here it's important to remember that the goal was not to schedule the features: just to separate the tiny features from the medium features from the huge features. I just went through each of the features and asked the developers to call out &quot;small,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; or &quot;large.&quot; Even without knowing how long a feature is going to take, it's easy to see that forking a bug is a &quot;small&quot; feature while the big, vague &quot;Personalizable Home Page&quot; feature was large. Based on the consensus estimate of costs and my own judgment, we put down prices on all the features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/pri1.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it's really messy, it's not exact, and it doesn't matter. You're not making a schedule today: you're just prioritizing. The only thing that you have to get approximately right is the vague idea that you could do two medium features or one large feature or ten small features in about the same amount of time. It doesn't have to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was making a menu of all thirty proposed features and their &quot;costs&quot;. Everybody on the team got a copy of the menu and was given $50 to play with. They could allocate their money any way they wanted, but they only had $50 to spend. They could buy half-features, if they wanted, or buy double features. Someone who really liked that Track Billable Time feature could spend $10 or $15 on it; someone who liked it a little might only spend $1 and hope that enough other people funded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we added up how much everyone spent on each feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/pri2.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I divided the amount spent by the cost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/pri3.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then sorted by this number to find the most popular features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/pri4.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ta da! A list of all the features you might want to do, in rough order of everyone's best idea of which features are the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you can start to refine. For example, you can clump together features that naturally belong together, for example, doing software schedules makes billable time easier, so maybe we should either do both or neither. And sometimes looking down the prioritized list it's just real obvious that something is messed up. So, you change it! Nothing is carved in stone. You can even change the prioritization as you go through development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what surprised me the most is that the final list we produced was really a very good prioritization for FogBugz 5.0, and really did reflect our collective consensus about the relative priorities of various features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority list in hand, we set out to more or less work down the list in order until about March, when we plan to stop adding new features and start the integration and testing phase. We'll write specs for each (nonobvious) feature right before implementing that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The nattering scorekeepers of the BDUF/Agile beauty contest are now thoroughly confused. &quot;Was that a vote for BDUF? Or Agile? What does he want? Can't he just take sides for once?!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole planning process took three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're lucky enough to have the ability to release software more frequently than we do, (see Picking a Ship Date), you still need to work down the list in order, but you can just stop and do releases more often. The good thing about frequent releases is that you can reprioritize the list regularly based on actual customer feedback, but not every product has this luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Conte taught me this system during the planning of Excel 5, where it only took a couple of hours even with a couple of dozen people in a conference room. The cool thing was that the roughly 50% of the features that we didn't have time to do were really stupid features, and Excel was better because it didn't have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Woo Your Skeptics With Credibility</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is an Investors Business Daily article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo Your Skeptics With Credibility&lt;br /&gt;
Published on Monday, August 22, 2005&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win over skeptics, goes the traditional wisdom, you build an airtight case that's tough to rebut. And you begin with a general statement that's sure to elicit agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad moves, says Samuel Bacharach, author of &quot;Get Them on Your Side.&quot; Skeptics don't care about the strength of your case, and they may not fall for the let's-both-agree opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most common mistake in trying to persuade skeptics is to think if you've got a good argument, that's enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't assume they'll see the wisdom of your idea and they'll trust you. You have to earn legitimacy first.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the what-how-why technique to gain credibility. Begin by explaining what you want to accomplish. Summarize your goal in the fewest words possible and speak in simple, jargon-free language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then describe how you want to achieve your goal. Conclude by letting skeptics know why you need them on your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a skeptical colleague to endorse your growth strategy, you can say, &quot;I want to grow sales by 25% a year, debt-free. I believe we can do this by increasing our customer retention rates and upgrading our target marketing. I need your support so that we can present a united front to our board and employees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;You must take the time to tell people why you need them in your corner.&quot; If you bark orders and demand compliance, skeptics will probably resist you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let resisters contribute ideas and propose alternatives to achieve your goal. Give them a chance to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Admit that you don't have all the answers,&quot; Bacharach said. &quot;That makes you seem more legitimate in their eyes and signals your willingness to listen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a shrewd negotiator, know when to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you repeatedly meet strong resistance, stop hammering away at your goal and try an alternate strategy. By pressing too hard, Bacharach says that you risk &quot;turning a resister into a saboteur.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you make too many tries to repeat and repackage your case, your ideas will look even weaker to the resister,&quot; he said. &quot;It's better to just quit and go around the resister.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dislike a skeptic, don't let your personal feelings undermine your persuasiveness. Separate your animosity from your efforts to listen and seek a resister's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the stale advice of starting a conversation with a skeptic by gaining agreement over big issues, Bacharach says. It's better to raise a small issue at an operational level that you both acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We tend to talk about big issues all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;But skeptics see past that.&quot; Just because you can both agree that the customer comes first won't get you very far in selling your idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's smarter to cite poor results in a particular market sector, Bacharach says. That way, you forge agreement over something specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can work together to tackle that narrow issue.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a way to launch an msi with logging turned on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;msiexec /l* logfile.txt /i MyMsi.msi&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then examine the log file. Note at the end of the log file it shows a dump of MSI properties.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The worst building on campus</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=3bu26ahhzukwmbvlc4xhgvja2qnhjdzn&quot;&gt;The worst building on campus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I once had an office -- a cubicle really -- in the physical-plant building of a major university. Gigantic machines rumbled all around me. My coffee mug sometimes vibrated off my desk. I used to pretend that I was an oiler in the engine room of the Lusitania. The room was well below ground level, and, during the rainy season, the entire floor would flood, sometimes to a depth of 18 inches. There were high water marks on the cinder-block walls from previous inundations. Mold ascended the fabric sides of my cubicle until, finally, it looked and smelled like a forest floor in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;After a couple of months -- and conversations with the other workers -- I learned that I could reach various points on the campus through underground steam tunnels. On my way back from teaching a class, I could pretend that I was Jean Valjean evading Inspector Javert in the sewers of Paris. My cubicle was so far from the center of campus that students rarely found me. Once, shortly after teaching Heart of Darkness, I asked one of my advisees &quot;Are you an assassin?&quot; And he said, without missing a beat, &quot;No, I'm an errand boy sent by grocery clerks.&quot; We laughed for two minutes. It was the high point of my semester.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Simple design, intense content: Tufte's design process</title>
                <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;amp;colID=13&amp;amp;articleID=00033494-443B-1237-81CB83414B7FFE9F&quot;&gt;Simple design, intense content: Tufte's design process&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tufte codified the design process into six principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;documenting the sources and characteristics of the data,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;insistently enforcing appropriate comparisons,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;demonstrating mechanisms of cause and effect,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;expressing those mechanisms quantitatively,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;recognizing the inherently multivariate nature of analytic problems,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;inspecting and evaluating alternative explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, &quot;information displays should be documentary, comparative, causal and explanatory, quantified, multivariate, exploratory, skeptical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;XP Home to XP Professional networking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your XP Pro machine has &quot;Use simple file sharing&quot; enabled, then the XP
Home machine will authenticate as guest. You don't need to enable the
guest account (in the User Accounts control panel) but you do need to edit
the local policy to allow guest to access the computer from the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;Local Policies-&amp;gt;User Rights Assignment-&amp;gt;Deny access to this computer from the network &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have &quot;use simple file sharing&quot; enabled, then the user on the
XP Home machine must have an account with the exact username and password
on the XP Pro machine for it to authenticate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, enabling the Guest account in the control panel enables enables local
logon for the Guest account.  I don't think it enables network logon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOW YOU LIVE CHANGES YOUR BRAIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most responsive organ of the body. Actually it is the organ that is most susceptible to change and regeneration of all the organs in the body. I have a friend named Gerald Edelman who was a great scholar of brain studies and says that the analogy of the brain to a computer is pathetic. The brain is actually more like an overgrown garden that is constantly growing and throwing off seeds, regenerating and so on. And he believes that the brain is susceptible, in a way that we are not fully conscious of, to almost every experience of our life and every encounter we have. I was fascinated by a story in a newspaper a few years ago about the search for perfect pitch. A group of scientists decided that they were going to find out why certain people have perfect pitch. You know certain people hear a note precisely and are able to replicate it at exactly the right pitch. Some people have relative pitch; perfect pitch is rare even among musicians. The scientists discovered - I don't know how - that among people with perfect pitch the brain was different. Certain lobes of the brain had undergone some change or deformation that was always present with those who had perfect pitch. This was interesting enough in itself. But then they discovered something even more fascinating. If you took a bunch of kids and taught them to play the violin at the age of 4 or 5 after a couple of years some of them developed perfect pitch, and in all of those cases their brain structure had changed. Well what could that mean for the rest of us? We tend to believe that the mind affects the body and the body affects the mind, although we do not generally believe that everything we do affects the brain. I am convinced that if someone was to yell at me from across the street my brain could be affected and my life might changed. That is why your mother always said, `Don't hang out with those bad kids.' Mama was right. Thought changes our life and our behaviour. I also believe that drawing works in the same way. I am a great advocate of drawing, not in order to become an illustrator, but because I believe drawing changes the brain in the same way as the search to create the right note changes the brain of a violinist. Drawing also makes you attentive. It makes you pay attention to what you are looking at, which is not so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>User perceptions of performance</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0301A&amp;amp;L=DOTNET-CLR&amp;amp;P=R2 3391&amp;amp;I=-3&quot;&gt;User perceptions of performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also should remember that users' perceptions of performance are not granular. Instead there are thresholds. I usually divide them into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blink of an eye&lt;br /&gt;
too quick to notice, no network operations make it here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short attention span&lt;br /&gt;
for most people this is about 10 seconds, you throw up an hourglass and they will stay in your app and wait),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email checking time&lt;br /&gt;
longer than 10 seconds and less than 90 seconds, most people will alt-tab out to another app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coffee time&lt;br /&gt;
90 seconds to a few minutes, people may walk away to get a cup of coffee, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batch job&lt;br /&gt;
nobody will wait on these willingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't move an operation from one category to the next, you really haven't made a noticeable improvement. As an example, if most of your webservice calls take 80 seconds and most remoting calls take 40 seconds, that's really not very significant. Your users will think your app stinks either way. If you can go from 16 seconds to 8 seconds on most calls, that's a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that the Girl Next Door moved to the big city. Think of Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. She's America's sweetheart with an urban sensibility. She's a post-Christian spiritualist, a pre-Monica Clintonite, and a dues-paying member of at least one social-change organization like NOW, Planned Parenthood, or the Sierra Club. You won't find her at an Earth First or PETA meeting, though. Those are the Granola Girl's stomping grounds. Progressive Girls want the world to be a better place, but they live out their politics in a moderate, left-of-center way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Greetings from Luang Prabang</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Lori and I left Chiang Khong, Thailand, for Laos. This was a real
adventure. The plan was to cross the Mekong River to Laos and to take a fast
boat from Huay Xai to Luang Prabang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of us was quite clear what a fast boat was. They are maybe thirty
inches wide, thirty feet long, and fifteen inches deep. And they go about 35
miles an hour for six hours. Passengers are rigged up in life jackets and
motorcycle helmets for safety sake. The boats have a reputation for flipping,
either because of striking rocks/logs in the water or currents or something
about low hanging tree branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the river and clearing Laos customs, we proceeded by tuk-tuk
with two other couples to the start site. Despite our expectation that we would
be six to a boat, we ended up going three in each of two boats, and we agreed
to change the split couple after lunch. We didn't realize, though, that we
would be using two boats only until we passed a Laos checkpoint. Then the
drivers brought us together and moved us all into a single boat. It was a scam
for appearance sake only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say a word here about the noise of these boats. They are loud. They
are audible at a distance of 500 meters and they impede conversation at any
lesser distance. In fact, before boarding, it was recommended that we buy pairs
of foam earplugs for 100 baht ($2.50 USD) for the trip. And even then you could
not really hear anything but the engine behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a brief overview of the trip is as follows: a cramped ride, subjected to
ear-splitting noise, all the while clutching at the gunwales as you contemplate
the possibility of imminent danger as the boat strikes eddies and standing
waves at about thirty-five miles per hour. For six hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it was amazing. The Mekong is surrounded on both sides by high
rolling mountains -- not fjord-style as in Chile and Norway but more gradual
and set back from the river. It is green everywhere. There is practically no
one else on the river for ten miles at a stretch. The river slopes away from
you, as if you are in a continuous fall for miles and miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We happened to have been quite lucky in our choice of travel companions. John
is a Canadian living and working in Thailand with a non-profit that does social
work. His girlfriend Laura is a nurse doing a master's degree at Guelph
University. They have lived for seven weeks and five weeks, respectively, in
Thailand, and they have a great command of Thai for the purposes of asking
directions and bargaining, two essential activities for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques is an American who has finished an undergraduate degree in political
science and economics from a school in Oregon, I think. He has ambitions to
join the American foreign service, even at the cost of surrendering his French
dual citizenship. His girlfriend Jessica is also American and studying to be a
nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was made even more cramped when we were joined after lunch by a very
taciturn Lao who sat in the seats in front of Lori and me. We were all very
alarmed at this development because of the additional weight in the boat and
the diminished manoueverability. I also noted that his pack was not well tied
into the pile at the front, and I expected at any moment that he would lunge
for his falling baggage, capsizing the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the light began to fade in the late afternoon, our driver picked up speed to
make it to Luang Prabang before sundown. In these parts, sundown is at 18:00
and it is an abrupt transition. Being caught after dark on the river would have
been more dangerous still. Fortunately, as it neared 18:00, we came upon the
boat landing unexpectedly -- it was just a bunch of bamboo poles in a floating
raft by the side of a steep hill with stairs leading to the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once out of the boat and with our packs hiked up the stairs, we had to decide
quickly on a hotel and to negotiate with the tuk-tuk drivers for a reasonable
rate. John and Laura were in fine form, showing genuine astonishment at the
prospect of paying 100 baht ($2.50 USD) per person for a 12 km ride. They
negotiated a 100 baht savings in all, acknowledging the limits of the
circumstances. Lori found a hotel in town to direct the driver to, and I
provided a flashlight and moral support in this team effort. Our glum Lao
friend climbed aboard for free and departed before Luang Prabang without a
word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was such a success that we six decided to go for dinner together after
dropping our stuff at our hotels. The consensus reached on the day: &quot;I expected
it to be dangerous but I had no idea it would be uncomfortable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luang Prabang is a sort of Indochinese Oxford, smaller and prettier and classier than the capital. It has the culture. It preserves the identity. It
thinks well of itself. It has specialities. It remains a slightly twee but
notable relic of Asie Fran&amp;ccedil;aise, which is nothing like the British India I'm
used to, all that sweat, duty, and cell-block architecture. The French relished
princely Luang Prabang, so poised within its confluence of rivers, so elegant,
with its pagoda roofs sweeping down like golden wings. Typically they found
Buddhism the religion smug and institutional but loved what it looked like,
that ascetic Buddhist aesthetic. They built villas and cafes to admire this
gorgeous East from; and today the monks, ever graceful in sunset orange, still
twirl their parasols along the promenade by those cafes, where French tourists
sit all afternoon in wicker chairs amidst the retro d&amp;eacute;cor, eating
tuna-and-watercress baguettes and drinking Beer Lao from imported tumblers. For
one long lunchtime moment it's Indochine as it never was but should have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Voters and the common absence of rational political preference</title>
                <description>&lt;h1&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/?040830crat_atlarge&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this evidence, three theories have arisen. The first is that electoral outcomes, as far as &quot;the will of the people&quot; is concerned, are
essentially arbitrary. The fraction of the electorate that responds to
substantive political arguments is hugely outweighed by the fraction that
responds to slogans, misinformation, &quot;fire alarms&quot; (sensational news), &quot;October
surprises&quot; (last-minute sensational news), random personal associations, and
&quot;gotchas.&quot; Even when people think that they are thinking in political terms,
even when they believe that they are analyzing candidates on the basis of their
positions on issues, they are usually operating behind a veil of political
ignorance. They simply don't understand, as a practical matter, what it means
to be &quot;fiscally conservative,&quot; or to have &quot;faith in the private sector,&quot; or to
pursue an &quot;interventionist foreign policy.&quot; They can't hook up positions with
policies. From the point of view of democratic theory, American political
history is just a random walk through a series of electoral options. Some
years, things turn up red; some years, they turn up blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second theory is that although people may not be working with a full deck of
information and beliefs, their preferences are dictated by something, and that
something is &amp;eacute;lite opinion. Political campaigns, on this theory, are
essentially struggles among the &amp;eacute;lite, the fraction of a fraction of voters who
have the knowledge and the ideological chops to understand the substantive
differences between the candidates and to argue their policy implications.
These voters communicate their preferences to the rest of the electorate by
various cues, low-content phrases and images (warm colors, for instance) to
which voters can relate, and these cues determine the outcome of the race.
Democracies are really oligarchies with a populist face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third theory of democratic politics is the theory that the cues to which
most voters respond are, in fact, adequate bases on which to form political
preferences. People use shortcuts--the social-scientific term is &quot;heuristics&quot;--to
reach judgments about political candidates, and, on the whole, these shortcuts
are as good as the long and winding road of reading party platforms, listening
to candidate debates, and all the other elements of civic duty. Voters use what
Samuel Popkin, one of the proponents of this third theory, calls
&quot;low-information rationality&quot;--in other words, gut reasoning--to reach political
decisions; and this intuitive form of judgment proves a good enough substitute
for its high-information counterpart in reflecting what people want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It exposes all the really cool things you can do with google that you'd never guess. Like, did you know that you can use google to look for movie reviews. I didn't. Or to search the news for a specific topic? Or to look up definitions? (I knew this last one but had forgotten about it.)&lt;br /&gt;

                <title>Lance Armstrong's right-hand man</title>

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully appreciate how much Lance Armstrong owes to Johan Bruyneel, maybe you'd have to watch Bruyneel steer a speeding car with his knees as he chases Armstrong through curvy mountain roads while juggling two-way radios, a cell phone and a map, and calls out tactical orders to the cyclist. Or maybe you would have to go back to those days just out of the hospital bed, when Armstrong couldn't imagine winning a bike race, and was just content to win his life back, until Bruyneel suggested he might be capable of more. Who, exactly, is Johan Bruyneel? &quot;Johan Bruyneel is the first person who put Lance Armstrong and the Tour de France in the same sentence,&quot; Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Cheney swears on the Senate floor</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/shouts/content/?040726sh_shouts&quot;&gt;New Yorker humor on swearing on the Senate floor&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President Dick Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, in a confrontation on the Senate floor while members were having their annual
group picture taken earlier this week. . . . According to [an] aide, Mr. Cheney
. . . responded with a barnyard epithet, urging Mr. Leahy to perform an
anatomical sexual impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--The Washington Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mr. Cheney successfully delivered the epithet and started to walk away, Mr. Leahy--sotto voce--referred to the Vice-President using a term more often
heard in taverns and locker rooms than in the august Senate chamber, a term
that refers to a sexual act commonly acknowledged as taboo among all cultures
that proscribe incestuous contact between a mother and a son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cheney--apparently hearing Mr. Leahy's remark--stopped, turned, and invited
his colleague from across the aisle to engage in a sexual act that is
considered a felony in some states, and which involves oral-genital contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Leahy then suggested that the president of the Senate take his gavel and
use it to perform an act that, while not technically impossible in anatomical
terms, would certainly be considered both unseemly and unhygienic, and which
would require an unusual combination of single-minded ambition and physical
relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cheney wasted no time in informing Mr. Leahy that he should feel free to
perform yet another anatomical impossibility--this one involving aviation, a
standard sexual act, and a rolling doughnut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, according to observers, both statesmen decided--by seemingly
unspoken mutual consent--to abandon the gutter patois of the common carnival
worker and to resort instead to an eminently more quotable (but, to those not
versed in the vagaries of hip-hop idiom, more confusing) exchange of
viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, it's like that?&quot; Mr. Cheney queried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whut? Whut?&quot; Mr. Leahy shot back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once again,&quot; Mr. Cheney replied (quite obviously quoting a lyric from Ice
Cube's 1990 album, &quot;AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted&quot;), &quot;it's on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick-thinking senatorial aide switched on the Senate's public-address
system and cued up the infamous &quot;Seven Minutes of Funk&quot; break, Mr. Leahy and
Mr. Cheney went head-to-head in what can only be described as a &quot;take no
prisoners&quot; freestyle rap battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the rhymes kicked therein cannot be quoted in a family publication, but
observers gave Mr. Cheney credit for his deceptively laid-back flow. Mr. Leahy
was applauded for managing to rhyme the phrases &quot;unethical for certain,&quot; &quot;crude
oil spurtin',&quot; and &quot;like Halliburton.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that both participants brought their A-game and succeeded in
dropping mad scientifics, the bout seemed to end in a draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as other senators (along with assorted aides and support-staff
members) were casting their votes to decide the winner, using the admittedly
subjective but generally accepted &quot;Make some noise up in here!&quot; protocols, Mr.
Cheney and Mr. Leahy took the proceedings to what one aide accurately described
as &quot;the next level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward M. Kennedy (D.-Mass.) was the first to notice that the two men were
circling each other, Mr. Cheney brandishing a switchblade and Mr. Leahy the
jagged neck of a broken bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, snap!&quot; Mr. Kennedy recalls thinking at the time. &quot;It's getting kind of
hectic up in this piece.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before either of the aggrieved public servants could bust a potentially
injurious move on his rival, cooler heads prevailed: a veteran Capitol Hill
security guard pacified the bloodthirsty white men (Mr. Leahy first, then Mr.
Cheney) with a shot from a tranquillizer gun. He then had them returned to
their cages in the sub-basement of the Old Executive Office Building, where
both men are kept and fed during non-business hours under the watchful eye of a
volunteer from Washington's National Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In a related story, an AM talk-radio host in Billings, Montana, who expressed
his disappointment with the behavior of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Leahy--on the air, he
asked his listeners, &quot;Do we taxpayers really have time for this kind of
crap?&quot;--was fined five hundred thousand dollars for violating the F.C.C.'s
recent, Senate-approved guidelines prohibiting explicit references to human
excrement.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On prediction markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote  class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this idea seem ludicrous? Since 1988, the University of Iowa has run the Iowa Electronic Markets, which allow people to bet on the outcome of
presidential elections. As a predictor, the Iowa Electronic Markets have
produced extraordinarily accurate judgments, often doing better than
professional polling organizations. In the week before each of the last four
elections, the predictions in the Iowa market have shown an average absolute
error of just 1.5 percentage points, a significant improvement over the 2.1
percentage point error in the final Gallup Polls. Or consider the Hollywood
Stock Exchange, in which people predict Oscar nominees and winners, as well as
opening weekend box-office successes. Here, too, the level of accuracy has been
exceptionally impressive, with (for example) correct predictions of thirty-five
out of forty Oscar nominees in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surowiecki might object that some crowds can be wise even when ignorance is
widespread. Consider the astonishing accuracy of the Iowa Electronic Markets
(and other prediction markets), in which good judgments come from groups of
investors that include many people who know little and are perhaps more likely
to be wrong than to be right. But we cannot easily generalize from prediction
markets, because they have several distinctive features. Most important, they
do not simply rely on the median or average judgment of a randomly selected
group of people. They are genuine markets, in which people voluntarily choose
to participate, presumably because they think they know something. In addition,
people are permitted to buy and to sell shares on a continuing basis. In these
circumstances, accurate answers can emerge even if only a small percentage of
participants have good information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Iowa Electronic Markets, it turns out that 85 percent of the traders
aren't so smart. They hold onto their shares for a long period and then just
accept someone else's prices. The market's predictions appear to be driven by
the other 15 percent--frequent traders who post their offers rather than
accepting those made by other people. The broader point is that to work well,
prediction markets do not require accurate judgments by anything like the
majority of participants. In this sense, prediction markets are very different
from judgments by ordinary crowds. Surowiecki's claims about group wisdom don't
adequately emphasize the unique characteristics of these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3830521.stm&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote  class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's most difficult word to translate has been identified as &quot;ilunga&quot;
from the Tshiluba language spoken in south-eastern DR Congo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came top of a list drawn up in consultation with 1,000 linguists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ilunga&lt;/em&gt; means &quot;a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to
tolerate it a second time, but never a third time&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>SCOTUS on the Pledge of Allegiance</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;SCOTUS turned down a non-custodial parent's suit to overturn the use of the
Pledge of Allegiance for its use of &quot;under God&quot; today. Rehnquist is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/14/scotus.pledge/index.html&quot;&gt;cited here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his minority opinion, Rehnquist wrote, &quot;To give the parent of such a child a sort of 'heckler's veto' over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase 'under God,' is an unwarranted extension of the establishment clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I take this to be an argument of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It's constitutional because it is patriotic;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It's constitutional because children do it willingly;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It's constitutional because the parent has no standing to bring suit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that (1) and (2) are ludicrous, and (2) particularly so. We have
a body of experts who decide constitutional matters of American law, and that
is the Supreme Court. That a justice on SCOTUS should decide to defer to the
estimates of school children as authorities on constitutionality is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped the Supreme Court would acquit itself more admirably than this. In
my opinion, this is a case of government endorsement of religion, but if SCOTUS
is going to dismiss the case, at Least it could come up with better reasons
than these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Remote assistance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;XP's Remote Desktop tool lets you remotely administer other Windows XP machines, as well as Windows 2000 and 2003 servers. On the client machine, select Start | All Programs | Accessories | Communications | Remote Desktop Connection, and enter the IP address of the computer you intend to connect to. If the connection is permitted, you'll get a window onto the server machine and be able to control it just as if you were sitting in front of its keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Conversely, you can set your Windows XP machine to accept connections from remote systems. Right-click on My Computer, select Properties, select the Remote tab, and mark the check box under Remote Desktop, then click on Select Remote Users... to specify who can access your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows XP's Remote Assistance lets you request help from a friend or help desk staff, who can then log on during a period of time you specify, taking control while you observe (and chat via Windows Messenger). For these remote tools to work, your firewall or router will need to permit traffic across port 3389.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FogBUGZ for bug-tracking (sorry Rob!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FinalBuilder for automated builds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeSMART to add all the Visual Studio features that Microsoft forgot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SourceGear Vault for source code control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groove, Yahoo IM, and Windows Messenger for distributed collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ndoc for developer documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoboHelp for end-user documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;InstallShield and Wise for installer creation (they tend to keep
edging each other out in features as they stagger releases; the new
InstallShield DevStudio 9 is very nice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AutoIt for little bits of automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeSmith for code generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeWright for text editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevPartner Studio for code analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dtSearch for finding things in the huge morass of e-mail and docs on
my network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PaintShop Pro for graphics twiddling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XMLSPY for XML editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NUnit for unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MindManager for brainstorming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMWare for virtual machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflector and ActivXplorer for spelunking&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Managed code wrapper for DDE&lt;/h1&gt;
In Search of Robust, Secure IPC for .NET&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn Van Ness&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;.NET Remoting Services are the recommended solution for interprocess communications in .NET, but there are many scenarios where .NET Remoting won't work. Shawn shows how to get simple, intrasession IPC messaging in .NET by creating a managed library for good old Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

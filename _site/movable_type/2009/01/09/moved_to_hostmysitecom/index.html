      <p>So if you are reading this, then you have been successfully redirected to my new website on hostmysite.com. Congratulations!</p>

<p>The whole adventure was not without some complications and extra steps. Partly, it was the change of internet host. In addition, I was changing from Movable Type 4.21 to MT 4.23, from Microsoft IIS to Apache, and from Windows to Linux. All of these factors contributed.</p>
<ul>
	<li>mt-config.cgi
<p>A lot of the problems flowed from the new mt-config.cgi file. Every Movable Type site has a mt-config.cgi file which describes where the CGI/Perl files can be found, where the generated static HTML files should go, and what the IP/URL of the website is. I was previously using MT under Microsoft IIS, and it allowed certain configuration errors that will haunt me.</p>
<p>MT is designed to allow multiple blogs to share a single domain. Typically, your blog is rooted at http://www.domain.com/blogname/index.html. In my case, I had mine rooted at http://www.domain.com/index.html because I put the MT code and generated files into a directory hierarchy that omitted the blog name. Unfortunately, that is really not possible in a typical Linux installation, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Linux sites set up (interpreted, executable) CGI files under /cgi-bin/ and (static, uninterpreted) HTML files under /htdocs/. Thus, you end up with your mt-static directory moved under htdocs and everything else put under cgi-bin.</p>
<p>Everything would still be cool if either:<ol>
	<li>I omitted the directory with the blog name (putting everything in the htdocs root) or</li>
	<li>I could find a way to configure mt-config.cgi to redirect to index.html without the blog name.</li>
</ol> Neither seemed desirable, so I now have iwebthereforeiam stuck between my domain and all pages.</p></li>

	<li>Hard-coded iwebthereforeiam.com / missing blog name
<p>Because of the change above, I could not have internal links that omitted the blog name. At a minimum, I had to change all these internal links. All of them used my domain name, so for simplicity, I just replaced the domain name with <strong>../..</strong>. That will work even if I someday discover a simple way to omit the blog name from URLs.</p></li>

	<li>Move static HTML/ASP files
<p>Because of laziness, I had placed many files into the root of my configuration. In most cases, it was easier to just put them into a new directory /htdocs/files/. In like fashion, I ended up adding some other directories to the root so that I did not go insane patching my entire site:</p>
<ul>
	<li>/files/</li>
	<li>/images/</li>
	<li>/projects/</li>
	<li>/sounds/</li>
	<li>/styles/</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li>Fix Movable Type templates
<p>I have a bunch of CSS and JavaScript packages on my site that have to be added to parts of the MT templates in order to flow through directly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>google-analytics</li>
	<li>code coloring with prettify.js and prettify.css</li>
	<li>snapshots from snap.com</li>
	<li>blockquote.quote</li>
</ul>
<p>I would have followed the instructions I posted some months ago for this, but MT 4.23 has removed some templates and added others, so I ended up figuring it out from scratch again. The gist of it is that anywhere that MT generates a <em>head</em> section, I needed to include the CSS and JS files, and anywhere that MT generates a <em>body</em> section, I needed to add an <em>onload</em> setting. The color coding involved adding the CSS and JavaScript inclusions to HTML Head:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/mt-static/css/prettify.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/mt-static/js/prettify.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>and then adding <em>onload="prettyPrint();"</em> to the body element of these templates:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search results</li>
	<li>Comment Preview</li>
	<li>Category Entry Listing</li>
	<li>Entry</li>
	<li>Monthly Entry Listing</li>
	<li>Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up google analytics and snap.com involved making modifications to the bottom of the template <em>Banner Footer</em>. I still have not got blockquote.quote in extra.css working.</p>
</li>

	<li>Add banned sites using mt_ipbanlist
<p>I have a huge collection of banned spammers from my previous site. I was not going to let them start spamming my trackbacks again, so I have to insert all these IP addresses into the MySQL table mt_ipbanlist. This will be a bit of a pain. I'll probably write a python script that does the insertions and upload the script to MySQL and let it chew on that for awhile. I imagine that must be how I did it before.</p></li>

	<li>Rewrite ASP pages
<p>SInce I was under Microsoft IIS for so long, I have old ASP pages that will have to be rewritten, probably in PHP. I'll have to evaluate why they had to be ASP (i.e. interpreted/dynamic ) in the first place.</p></li>

	<li>Redirect name servers
<p>This was the final step in throwing the switch. Once I did this, web surfers could find my new site with the old domain name. I had to add in an HTML file with a redirect to deal with the absence of the blog name:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" 
content="3; url=http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/index.html"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redirecting to &lt;a href="http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/index.html"&gt;new blog location&lt;/a&gt; in 3 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</li>

	<li>Alert the search engines
<p>Because of the addition of the blog name to the middle of the URL, most all URLs in the search engines are now bad. Sigh. So I have to resubmit my site for spidering.</p></li>

</ul>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>Update 2009-01-09: Unbelievable. The whole problem with the blockquote.quote style in extra.css was that the file began with a C++-style comment and the entire file was interpreted as if it was commented out. Some sort of Unix versus Windows/LF versus CR-LF issue. Totally resolved by taking out the comment.</p>

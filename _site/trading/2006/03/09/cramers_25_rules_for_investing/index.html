<p>Rule No. 1: Bulls, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered<br />
It's essential for all traders to know when to take some off the table.</p>

<p>Rule No. 2: It's OK to Pay the Taxes<br />
Stop fearing the tax man and start fearing the loss man because gains can be fleeting.</p>

<p>Rule No. 3: Don't Buy All at Once<br />
To maximize your profits, stage your buys, work your orders and try to get the best price over time.</p>

<p>Rule No. 4: Buy Damaged Stocks, Not Damaged Companies<br />
There are no refunds on Wall Street, so do your research and focus your trades on damaged stocks rather than companies.</p>

<p>Rule No. 5: Diversify to Control Risk<br />
If you control the downside and diversify your holdings, the upside will take care of itself.</p>

<p>Rule No. 6: Do Your Stock Homework<br />
Before you buy any stock, it's important to research all aspects of the company.</p>

<p>Rule No. 7: No One Made a Dime by Panicking<br />
There will always be a better time to leave the table, so it is best to avoid the fleeing masses.</p>

<p>Rule No. 8: Buy Best-of-Breed Companies<br />
Investing in the more expensive stock is invariably worth it because you get piece of mind.</p>

<p>Rule No. 9: Defend Some Stocks, Not All<br />
When trading gets tough, pick your favorite stocks and defend only those.</p>

<p>Rule No. 10: Bad Buys Won't Become Takeovers<br />
Bad companies never get bids, so it's the good fundamentals you need to focus on.</p>

<p>Rule No. 11: Don't Own Too Many Names<br />
It can be constraining, but it's better to have a few positions you know well and like.</p>

<p>Rule No. 12: Cash Is for Winners<br />
If you don't like the market or have anything compelling to buy, it's never wrong to go with cash.</p>

<p>Rule No. 13: No Woulda, Shoulda, Couldas<br />
This damaging emotion is destructive to the positive mindset needed to make investment decisions.</p>

<p>Rule No. 14: Expect, Don't Fear Corrections<br />
It is not always clear when a correction will strike, so expect and be prepared for one at all times.</p>

<p>Rule No. 15: Don't Forget Bonds<br />
It's important to watch more than stocks, and bonds are stocks' direct competition.</p>

<p>Rule No. 16: Never Subsidize Losers With Winners<br />
Any trader stuck in this position would do well to sell sinking stocks and wait a day.</p>

<p>Rule No. 17: Check Hope at the Door<br />
Hope is emotion, pure and simple, and trading is not a game of emotion.</p>

<p>Rule No. 18: Be Flexible<br />
Recognize and be open to the unexpected shifts in the market because business, by nature, is dynamic, not static.</p>

<p>Rule No. 19: When the Chiefs Retreat, So Should You<br />
High-level executives don't quit a company for personal reasons, so that is a sign something is wrong.</p>

<p>Rule No. 20: Giving Up on Value Is a Sin<br />
If you don't have patience, think about letting someone who does run your money.</p>

<p>Rule No. 21: Be a TV Critic<br />
Accept that what you hear on television is probably right, but no more than that.</p>

<p>Rule No. 22: Wait 30 Days After Preannouncements<br />
Preannouncements signal ongoing weakness, wait 30 days to see if anything has gotten better before you pull the trigger to buy.</p>

<p>Rule No. 23: Beware of Wall Street Hype<br />
Never underestimate the promotion machine because analysts get behind stocks and can keep them propelled in an up direction well beyond reason.</p>

<p>Rule No. 24: Explain Your Picks<br />
Buying stocks is a solitary event, too solitary in fact, so always make sure you can articulate your reasoning to someone else.</p>

<p>Rule No. 25: There's Always a Bull Market<br />
It's OK if you have to work hard to find it, just don't default to what's in bear mode because you are time-constrained or intellectually lazy.</p>

      <p>On a recent interview, I was asked: "Why doesn't C# have keywords for const-correctness?"</p>

<p>There are a few answers. First, C# does have constants and <em>const</em> class members. You can declare class members as <em>const</em> or <em>readonly</em> to get compile-time and run-time constants, respectively.</p>

<p>And it's even possible to write classes that are immutable, so that you cannot modify an existing one but have to make a new one, possibly based on an existing one. It's like strings:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">    s.replace("The", "An");</pre>
does not modify the original string. Instead, you have to take the return value:
<pre class="prettyprint">    s = s.replace("The", "An");</pre>
<p>It won't come as a great surprise to hear that I favor making classes immutable wherever they can be, as a means of clarifying their usage and to make them safer.</p>

<p>But the real question is: why doesn't C# have const methods (methods where the code promises not to modify class members) or methods that respect const parameters? The nearest I have found to an answer on that is <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/choicesP.html">Anders Hejlsberg in an online interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><h1>Immutables</h1>

<p><strong>Bill Venners</strong>: In addition to being a C# and CLR construct, the value type is a general object-oriented programming concept. Another such concept is immutable types.</p>

<p>When I went to the first JavaOne back in 1996, everyone seemed to have one complaint about what they missed from C++ that Java didn't have. Different people had different complaints, but they all seemed to have at least one complaint. My complaint was const. I really liked what I could do with const in C++, though somehow I have gotten along in Java just fine without it.</p>

<p>Did you consider including support for the concept of immutable directly in C# and the CLR?</p>

<p><strong>Anders Hejlsberg</strong>: There are two questions in here. With respect to immutability, it's tricky because what you're saying when you say something is immutable, is that from an external perspective, I cannot observe any mutation. That doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have a cache inside that makes it go more efficiently. It's just on the outside it looks immutable. That's hard for a compiler to figure out. We could certainly have a rule that says you can only modify the fields of this object in the constructor. And we could make certain usability guarantees. But it actually rules out some scenarios that are in use. So we haven't codified immutability as a hard guarantee, because it's a hard guarantee to make. The concept of an immutable object is very useful, but it's just up to the author to say that it's immutable.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Venners</strong>: Immutability is part of the semantics of the class.</p>

<p><strong>Anders Hejlsberg</strong>: Yes. With respect to const, it's interesting, because we hear that complaint all the time too: "Why don't you have const?" Implicit in the question is, "Why don't you have const that is enforced by the runtime?" That's really what people are asking, although they don't come out and say it that way.</p>

<p>The reason that const works in C++ is because you can cast it away. If you couldn't cast it away, then your world would suck. If you declare a method that takes a const Bla, you could pass it a non-const Bla. But if it's the other way around you can't. If you declare a method that takes a non-const Bla, you can't pass it a const Bla. So now you're stuck. So you gradually need a const version of everything that isn't const, and you end up with a shadow world. In C++ you get away with it, because as with anything in C++ it is purely optional whether you want this check or not. You can just whack the constness away if you don't like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The interviewees approach "Immutability [as] part of the semantics of the class." They consider this the relevant feature, not semantics of individual methods of a class.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/04/22/118238.aspx">Eric Gunnerson</a> also considers const-correctness "a good idea in the small, but doesn't work too well in the large." Furthermore, he points out that it is hard to enforce across multiple languages.</p>

<p>There are also many entries on StackOverFlow.com on this question (searchable <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=C%23+%22const+correctness%22">here</a>), and the best answer provided is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/528122/why-doesnt-c-offer-constness-akin-to-c">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>I suspect there are some practical reasons, and some theoretical reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Should the constness apply to the object or the reference? If it's in the reference, should this be compile-time only, or as a bit within the reference itself? Can something else which has a non-const reference to the same object fiddle with it under the hood?</li>
	<li>Would you want to be able to cast it away as you can in C++? That doesn't sound very much like something you'd want on a managed platform... but what about all those times where it makes sense in C++?</li>
	<li>Syntax gets tricky (IMO) when you have more than one type involved in a declaration - think arrays, generics etc. It can become hard to work out exactly which bit is const.</li>
	<li>If you can't cast it away, everyone has to get it right. In other words, both the .NET framework types and any other 3rd party libraries you use all have to do the right thing, or you're left with nasty situations where your code can't do the right thing because of a subtle problem with constness.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a big one in terms of why it can't be supported now though:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Backwards compatibility: there's no way all libraries would be correctly migrated to it, making it pretty much useless :(</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree it would be useful to have some sort of constness indicator, but I can't see it happening, I'm afraid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, approaches you can use to get immutability at the class level:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable object pattern</a><br />
	Class is immutable by design, made so by the developer</li>
	<li>collections returned as AsReadOnly<br />
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e78dcd75.aspx">List</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53kysx7b.aspx">Array</a> generic classes both support this method.</li>
	<li>class members that are marked as <em>readonly</em> or <em>const</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The first two would support immutable method parameters -- you could not change them in the scope of the function and get side-effects. But C++-style const-correctness on methods is not available by language syntax.</p>

      <a href="http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/201804248">James Reinders on parallel programming</a><br /><br />
<p>Programming for multicore processors poses new challenges. Here are
eight rules for multicore programming to help you be successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think parallel. Approach all problems looking for the
parallelism. Understand where parallelism is, and organize your
thinking to express it. Decide on the best parallel approach before
other design or implementation decisions. Learn to "Think Parallel."</li>
<li>Program using abstraction. Focus on writing code to express parallelism, but
avoid writing code to manage threads or processor cores. Libraries,
OpenMP, and Intel Threading Building Blocks are all examples of using
abstractions. Do not use raw native threads (pthreads, Windows threads,
Boost threads, and the like). Threads and MPI are the assembly
languages for parallelism. They offer maximum flexibility, but require
too much time to write, debug, and maintain. Your programming should be
at a high-enough level that your code is about your problem, not about
thread or core management.</li>
<li>Program in tasks (chores), not threads (cores). Leave the mapping of tasks to threads or processor cores as a distinctly separate operation in your program, preferably an abstraction you are using that handles thread/core management for you.
Create an abundance of tasks in your program, or a task that can be
spread across processor cores automatically (such as an OpenMP loop).
By creating tasks, you are free to create as many as you can without
worrying about oversubscription.</li>
<li>Design with the option to
turn concurrency off. To make debugging simpler, create programs that
can run without concurrency. This way, when debugging, you can run
programs first with--then without--concurrency, and see if both runs fail
or not. Debugging common issues is simpler when the program is not
running concurrently because it is more familiar and better supported
by today's tools. Knowing that something fails only when run
concurrently hints at the type of bug you are tracking down. If you
ignore this rule and can't force your program to run in only one
thread, you'll spend too much time debugging. Since you want to have
the capability to run in a single thread specifically for debugging, it
doesn't need to be efficient. You just need to avoid creating parallel
programs that require concurrency to work correctly, such as many
producer-consumer models. MPI programs often violate this rule, which
is part of the reason MPI programs can be problematic to implement and
debug.</li>
<li>Avoid using locks. Simply say "no" to locks. Locks
slow programs, reduce their scalability, and are the source of bugs in
parallel programs. Make implicit synchronization the solution for your
program. When you still need explicit synchronization, use atomic
operations. Use locks only as a last resort. Work hard to design the
need for locks completely out of your program.</li>
<li>Use tools
and libraries designed to help with concurrency. Don't "tough it out"
with old tools. Be critical of tool support with regards to how it
presents and interacts with parallelism. Most tools are not yet ready
for parallelism. Look for threadsafe libraries--ideally ones that are
designed to utilize parallelism themselves.</li>
<li>Use scalable
memory allocators. Threaded programs need to use scalable memory
allocators. Period. There are a number of solutions and I'd guess that
all of them are better than <i>malloc().</i> Using scalable memory
allocators speeds up applications by eliminating global bottlenecks,
reusing memory within threads to better utilize caches, and
partitioning properly to avoid cache line sharing.</li>
<li>Design
to scale through increased workloads. The amount of work your program
needs to handle increases over time. Plan for that. Designed with
scaling in mind, your program will handle more work as the number of
processor cores increase. Every year, we ask our computers to do more
and more. Your designs should favor using increases in parallelism to
give you advantages in handling bigger workloads in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote these rules with explicit mention of threading everywhere. Only
rule #7 is specifically related to threading. Threading is not the only
way to get value out of multicore. Running multiple programs or
multiple processes is often used, especially in server applications.</p>

<p>These rules will work well for you to get the most out of multicore.
Some will grow in importance over the next 10 years, as the number of
processor cores rises and we see an increase in the diversity of the
cores themselves. The coming of heterogeneous processors and NUMA, for
instance, makes rule #3 more and more important.</p>

<p>You should understand all eight and take all eight to heart. I look
forward to any comments you may have about these rules or parallelism
in general.</p>
